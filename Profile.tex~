\begin{slide}{Repeated measures by profile analysis}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item More than one response {\em measurement} for each subject. Might be
    \begin{itemize}
    \item measurements of the same thing at different times
    \item measurements of different (but related) things
    \end{itemize}
  \item Variation: each subject does several different treatments at different times (called {\em crossover design}).
  \item Expect measurements on same subject to be correlated, so
    assumptions of independence will fail.
  \item Called {\em repeated measures}. Different approaches, but {\em profile analysis} uses PROC GLM and looks like MANOVA.
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

  \begin{slide}{Some fake data}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Here are some data I made up:

\begin{verbatim}
a 10 10 9 10
a 11 9 10 11
a 10 11 10 9
b 9 10 12 10
b 11 10 10 8
b 11 10 8 9
\end{verbatim}


    \item 6 subjects; 2 treatments A and B, 4 (repeated) measurements of some response (at 4 different times).
    \item Nothing much happening:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item no difference between the treatments (no treatment effect)
      \item no trend over time (values just ``jumping about randomly'' for each subject).
      \end{itemize}
    \item Expect to see no significant test results.
    \item Imagine plotting mean response ($y$-axis) vs.\ time ($x$-axis), labelling response by treatment --- ``profile''.


    \end{itemize}
    
  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}{Doing a repeated measures analysis}

\begin{verbatim}
data rm;
  infile "rm1.dat";
  input trt $ y1 y2 y3 y4;

proc glm;
  class trt;
  model y1 y2 y3 y4 = trt / nouni;
  repeated time;

\end{verbatim}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item In ``model'', put the multiple responses to left of =, like MANOVA.
    \item \verb-nouni- suppresses univariate ANOVAs (not valid/helpful anyway).
    \item specify that the 4 responses are measurements at different times.
    \item Output contains 2 MANOVAs and a univariate ANOVA.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item No trend over time for either treatment. (No evidence that mean responses at different times are different.)
\item Next test time by treatment interaction, also
  non-significant: no overall difference in response over times, so
  that non-pattern must be same for both treatment groups.

This tests whether there is a treatment effect, by comparing mean of
the 4 response variables for the treatment groups (so is ordinary
ANOVA). Not significant either.

\vspace{3ex}

Next, change the data to produce a treatment effect but still no time trend:

\end{verbatim}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Now treatment B looks to have a slightly higher mean, so we might find a significant treatment effect.
    \item Still no apparent differences between times, same for each treatment.
    \item Run same code on this data set (changing only name of data file).

Treatment effect we introduced is indeed significant.

\vspace{1ex}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Introducing a time effect}

Now make another change to data:

\begin{verbatim}
a 10 10 11 13
a 11 9 12 14

b 11 10 15 15

\end{verbatim}

This time responses at times 3 and 4 seem higher, so expect a time effect now. But pattern of responses over time still same for both treatments, so don't expect a treatment-by-time interaction.

\vspace{3ex}

Run the same code again.

  \item Do subjects from different professions differ in what they think about different leisure activities?
  \item 3 occupational groups, bellydancers, politicians and administrators; 5 subjects from each group.
  \item Each subject participates in 4 activities, reading, dancing, TV-watching, skiing; rates satisfaction with each on 10-point scale.
  \item Data like this. (Scores on activities as listed.)

\begin{slide}{Comments}

\begin{itemize}
\item First, a check that the responses are all scores on different activities. SAS: ``activity'' means ``the four responses combined''.
\item This test: ``flatness'': do all the activities have the same average score for each profession group? Answer clearly no.
\end{itemize}
  
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Another example}
  
Use SAS example 32.7 data for a second example (dogs).
