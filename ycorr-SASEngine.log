You are running SAS 9. Some SAS 8 files will be automatically converted 
by the V9 engine; others are incompatible.  Please see 
http://support.sas.com/rnd/migration/planning/platform/64bit.html

PROC MIGRATE will preserve current SAS file attributes and is 
recommended for converting all your SAS libraries from any 
SAS 8 release to SAS 9.  For details and examples, please see

WARNING: No _TYPE_ variable in the TYPE=CORR data set WORK.YC.
WARNING: No _NAME_ variable in the TYPE=CORR data set WORK.YC. Be 
         sure that the variables are specified in the same order as 
         the corresponding observations appear in the data set.
NOTE: The means of one or more variables in the input data set 
      WORK.YC are missing and are assumed to be 0.
NOTE: The standard deviations of one or more variables in the input 
      data set WORK.YC are missing and are assumed to be 1.
WARNING: The data set WORK.YC does not indicate how many observations 
         were used to compute the CORR matrix. The number of 
         observations has been set to 10000. Statistics that depend 
         on the number of observations (such as p-values) are not
