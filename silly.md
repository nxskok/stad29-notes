This is the title
=================
Here is some data:


```r
x = c(10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 22, 24, 27, 41)
x
```

```
##  [1] 10 11 13 14 17 18 22 24 27 41
```


and this is a summary of x:


```r
summary(x)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    10.0    13.2    17.5    19.7    23.5    41.0
```


Finally, a boxplot of x:


```r
boxplot(x)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](figure/unnamed-chunk-3.png) 


from which we see that x is right-skewed.
