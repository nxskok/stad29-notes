\begin{slide}{Analysis of covariance}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item ANOVA: explanatory variables categorical (divide data into groups)
  \item traditionally, analysis of covariance has categorical $x$'s plus one numerical $x$ (``covariate'') to be adjusted for.
  \item PROC GLM handles this too.
  \item Simple example: two treatments (drugs) (\verb-a- and \verb-b-), with before and after scores. 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item 
Does knowing before score and/or treatment help to predict after score?
\item Is after score different by treatment/before score?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Data}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Get means of before and after scores for each treatment.
  \item Make sure \verb-drug- treated as categorical (``class'')
  \item Before score treated as numeric by default
  \item Interaction means ``effect of before score on after score is different for each treatment''. Fit this first.

  \item Assuming linear dependence of after score on before score has {\em same slope} for both treatments (though possibly different intercept).
  \item Get predicted means for ``after'' score depending on \verb-drug- and \verb-before-.
  \item Also get means for treatments ``adjusted'' for before score.

\begin{slide}{Interpreting the output}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Requires care!
  \item Model as a whole is significant.
  \item Type I SS says ``is each variable significant when added {\em in order}: that is:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \verb-drug- added to a model containing nothing (not sig)
    \item \verb-before- added to model containing only \verb-drug- (sig)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Not really what we want to know.
  \item Type III SS: ``can I take this variable out of a model
    containing everything?'' Answer in both cases no. Interpretation:
    once you allow for before score, there is a significant difference
    between treatments. (But if you don't allow for before score, there
    isn't.)
  \end{itemize}

\end{verbatim}
}

\begin{itemize}
\item Prediction for treatment A about 5 units higher than for treatment B at the same before score --- same difference as between LSMEANS.
\item Consistent because no interaction.
\item If interaction had been included, A might be higher for some before scores and B higher for others: clouds interpretation.
