\question Hand this one in. An experiment tested the effects of three treatments,
labelled A, B and C, on performance \texttt{y} at some task, on a scale from 0 to
200, with higher being better (I don't know what
this task is). Also measured for each subject was a measure of skill, \texttt{S}, on a scale
from 0 to 100 (higher means more skill).  Of primary interest was
whether the treatments differ in their impact on performance. The data
are in \url{http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/perf.txt}.

\begin{parts}
  \part[2] Read the data and convince yourself (and the grader) that
  you have the variables you need.
  
  \begin{solution}
    The usual:
<<>>=
performance=read.table("perf.txt",header=T)
str(performance)
@     

or, if you like, 

<<>>=
head(performance)
@ 

We have the variables \texttt{y} (performance), \texttt{S} (skill) and
\texttt{treatment}, as promised. I'm not picky about whether you use
\texttt{str} or \texttt{head}; anything that shows that you have the
right variables is OK. Even this works:

<<>>=
names(performance)
@ 

The advantage to \texttt{str}, to my mind, is that you get to see
how many observations you have, in this case 90, and also which
different treatments there are, here A, B and C. 
  \end{solution}
  
  \part[2] Why would analysis of covariance be a useful technique in
  this problem? Explain briefly.
  
  \begin{solution}
    The crucial thing that makes ANCOVA the right technique here is that
    we have an analysis-of-variance situation (performance depending
    on a categorical treatment), but we \emph{also} have a continuous
    explanatory variable Skill that might (probably will) also have an
    impact on performance.
    
    In  bullet points, we need all three of these things:
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item a numerical response variable (\texttt{y}, performance)
    \item at least one categorical explanatory variable (\texttt{treatment})
    \item at least one numerical explanatory variable (\texttt{S},
      skill). 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{solution}
  
  \part[3] Make a plot of performance against skill, but with the
  points coloured according to which \texttt{treatment} they come
  from. Add a legend to your plot that shows which treatment is which.
  
  \begin{solution}
    The hard part of this is the legend. Here's a way it can go:
    
<<>>=
attach(performance)
plot(y~S,col=treatment)
legend("topleft",levels(treatment),fill=1:3)
@     

The \texttt{fill} trick is handy in legends to get filled boxes of the
appropriate colour. You could also distinguish points by plotting
character as well as colour, and then you need to put both things in
the legend:

<<>>=
plot(y~S,col=treatment,pch=as.numeric(treatment))
legend("topleft",levels(treatment),col=1:3,pch=1:3)
@ 

Doing it this way there is a symmetry: \texttt{col} and \texttt{pch}
in the \texttt{plot}, and also \texttt{col} and \texttt{pch} in the
legend. This makes it easier to remember everything, but there is the
annoyance that \texttt{pch} has to be a number, so you have to create one.

In the first
graph, you could have your legend show coloured circles by saying
\texttt{col=1:3} but \emph{also} \texttt{pch=1} (a circle is plotting
character number 1). Otherwise, your legend would have different
coloured nothings!

Finally, another option is to use \texttt{ggplot}, which will take
care of the legend for you. That goes like this:

<<>>=
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(performance,aes(x=S,y=y,colour=treatment))+geom_point()
@ 

or even

<<>>=
ggplot(performance,aes(x=S,y=y,colour=treatment,shape=treatment))+
  geom_point()
@ 

Now that I'm used to the process, I find \texttt{ggplot} easier (and I
like the fact that it makes a legend without my having to think about
it). But either way is good for this question.

In the second \texttt{ggplot}, \texttt{shape=} can go either in the
original \texttt{aes} (the setup for the whole plot), or in the
\verb=geom_point= (specific for the plotting of points). In a way,
it's more logical to put the \texttt{shape} in the \verb=geom_point=,
since that's the only place the \texttt{shape} gets used.
  \end{solution}
  
  \part[2] Does there seem to be an effect of Skill? Explain briefly.
  
  \begin{solution}
    If you look at any one of the treatment groups, as Skill goes up,
    Performance goes strongly up as well. (Or, if you like, look at
    the overall scatter, but then the effect of Skill is confounded
    with \texttt{treatment}.) So I would definitely expect to see a
    significant effect of Skill.
  \end{solution}
  
  \part[3] Does there seem to be an effect of \texttt{treatment}?
  Explain briefly. If there is an \texttt{treatment} effect, which
  treatment or treatments seem different from the others?
  
  \begin{solution}
    If you look at your graph, the treatment A points seem to be
    consistently at the bottom all the way across: that is, for any
    level of Skill, the Performance for a person on treatment A is
    consistently worse than someone on the other treatments.
    
    It's up to you whether you think there's a difference between
    treatments B and C. There is a fair bit of overlap among these
    points, but I think the treatment C points are usually above the
    treatment B ones. I'm happy either way. If you say something about
    B and C, just make sure you explain why you think so.
  \end{solution}
  
  \part[3] Fit an analysis of covariance model with interaction and
  display the \texttt{anova} of it.
  
  \begin{solution}
    Use \texttt{lm}:
    
<<>>=
performance.1=lm(y~S*treatment,data=performance)
anova(performance.1)
@     

You can actually get the same result using \texttt{aov} (surprisingly,
even with the numeric explanatory variable):

<<>>=
performance.2=aov(y~S*treatment,data=performance)
summary(performance.2)
@ 

I didn't know you could do this until about 3 minutes ago. I guess I
never tried it to see what would happen.
  \end{solution}
  
  \part[2]\label{part:int} Interpret your \texttt{anova} table. What is the major
  conclusion from it, in the context of this data set?
  
  \begin{solution}
    The second sentence of the question is meant to alert you to the
    fact that once you have seen the significant interaction, that's
    where you stop looking.
    
    There is a significant interaction between Skill and
    \texttt{treatment}: that is to say, the effect of Skill on
    Performance is \emph{different} for each \texttt{treatment}. 
    
    That's as much as you can say at this point, because without
    looking at fitted lines for each \texttt{treatment} you cannot say
    \emph{how} the treatment effects differ. (That's coming up.)
  \end{solution}
  
  \part[3]\label{part:gg} Use \texttt{ggplot} to plot Performance against Skill, with 
  the points coloured by \texttt{treatment}. On that plot, also
  include regression lines for predicting Performance from Skill
  \emph{within each \texttt{treatment} group}. (This is the simpler
  version of plotting lines for each group, and not the complicated
  version where the lines are constrained to have the same slope.)
  
  \begin{solution}
    If you did the \texttt{ggplot} graph before, this is only a matter
    of adding something to it. If not, you'll need the \texttt{aes}
    ingredients of an \texttt{x}, a \texttt{y} and a \texttt{colour},
    and then a \verb=geom_point= to plot the points and a
    \verb=geom_smooth= with \texttt{method="lm"} to plot the lines,
    which will come out one for each group:
    
<<>>=
ggplot(performance,aes(x=S,y=y,colour=treatment))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
@     

This, as usual with \texttt{ggplot} code, is simpler than you might
think at first, because all the grouping stuff is handled by the
\texttt{colour=treatment} in the \texttt{aes}. 
  \end{solution}
  
  \part[3] Consider your conclusion in part (\ref{part:int}) and
  your graph in part (\ref{part:gg}). Explain briefly how they are
  consistent with each other.
  
  \begin{solution}
    The significant interaction in the \texttt{anova} said that the
    effect of Skill on Performance was different for each
    \texttt{treatment} group. This plays out in ANCOVA as the slopes
    being different for each group. If you look at the graph in
    (\ref{part:gg}), you'll see that the treatment C line (blue on my
    plot) is not parallel to the treatment B line (green), because
    they start out close together on the left and finish farther apart
    on the right. It is probably also true that the treatment A line
    is less steep than the others, but that's harder to judge, and,
    besides, all you need for a significant interaction is for
    \emph{two} of the slopes to be significantly different from each
    other. 
    
    That's all I needed, but I have a lot more discussion below.
    
    You might (reasonably) say ``those slopes are not really
    \emph{very} different'', especially in the light of the previous
    question, where the slopes were more different, but the
    interaction was not significant. Certainly, in this case, even
    though the slopes are significantly different, you could with good
    conscience recommend treatment C at all skill levels. The issue is
    how good the evidence is for the difference in slopes. In this
    question, everything is estimated accurately (those grey
    ``envelopes'' around the lines are pretty small), so that even a
    small difference among the slopes is significant. This is because
    the trend is clear within each group: the points of each colour
    follow their respective coloured lines well. In contrast, in the
    previous question, the points are all over the place, so the lines
    are estimated much less accurately, and the grey envelopes are a
    lot bigger and overlap much more.
    
    Normally, we would look at the \texttt{summary} of our preferred
    analysis of covariance model:
    
<<>>=
summary(performance.1)
@     

but that is more difficult to understand in the presence of an
interaction. 

When we're assessing significance, we start at the bottom with the
highest-order interaction. But when interpreting coefficients, it's
easier to start at the top. Note that treatment A doesn't appear here
at all, because treatment A is the baseline (first alphabetically).

So:

\begin{itemize}
\item the intercept, 14.56, is for treatment A: a person with Skill 0
  on treatment A is predicted to have a Performance of 14.56.\endnote{No-one in our data
    set actually \emph{has} a Skill of zero, which makes interpreting
    the intercept rather difficult; for this reason, some people
    advocate ``centring'' the Skill scores to have a mean of zero, by
    subtracting the mean first. If that is done, the intercept would
    give you the mean Performance score for a person of \emph{average}
  skill, which is much easier to make sense of.}
\item the slope for \texttt{S}, 0.92, is also for treatment A. On
  treatment A, an increase in Skill of 1 point is associated with an
  increase in Performance of 0.92 points.
\item The coefficient for treatment B, 17.10 (which I am trying to
  avoid calling a ``slope'', since it isn't one) expresses the change
  in \emph{intercept} for treatment B over treatment A. That means a
  person on treatment B with Skill 0 is predicted to have Performance
  $14.56+17.10=31.66$. This is positive and large, expressing that
  treatment B is overall better than treatment A.
\item The coefficient for treatment C is 17.76. This is again saying
  how the \emph{intercept} for treatment C compares to that for A: for
  treatment C the intercept is $14.56+17.76=32.32$. This, again, is
  substantially positive, and so treatment C is substantially better
  than treatment A. On the other hand, the intercept coefficients for
  treatments B and C are similar, and that means, at least for
  individuals with low Skill on these two treatments, their
  performance is going to be fairly similar. (What about individuals
  with high skill on these treatments? Coming up.)
  

\item The interaction term for Skill and treatment B is 0.23. That
  means that the \emph{slope} for treatment B, as compared to the
  slope for treatment A, is 0.23: the line is 0.23 steeper, or has a
  slope of $0.92+0.23=1.15$.
\item The interaction term for Skill and treatment C is 0.50. Thus the
  line for treatment C is 0.50 steeper than the line for treatment A,
  that is, its slope is 1.42. The line for treatment C is the steepest
  of all, which means that even though the lines for treatments B and
  C start off close together on the graph, by the end, for larger
  Skill scores, they are further apart. That is, treatment C is more
  beneficial when the Skill score is large.
  
  These last two coefficients are small
  (though significantly nonzero) compared to the intercept ones,
  meaning that the slopes for 
  treatments B and C are close to the slope for treatment A, even
  though their intercepts are greatly different. (If these two
  interaction coefficients had been \emph{exactly} zero, the
  differences in slopes between the lines would have been exactly zero
  as well: that is, the lines would have been exactly parallel.)
\end{itemize}

Finally, you were probably wondering about something like Tukey for
comparing treatments. Here, we're taking advantage of being able to
fit the model as an \texttt{aov}:

<<>>=
TukeyHSD(performance.2)
@ 

Not surprisingly, all three treatments are significantly
different. Don't worry about the warnings: they are because \texttt{S}
is numerical, and \texttt{TukeyHSD} can't handle that, as we would expect.

Suppose we had ignored Skill and just done a one-way ANOVA. What would
have happened then?

<<>>=
performance.3=aov(y~treatment,data=performance)
summary(performance.3)
@ 

Strongly significant effect of treatment. Tukey:

<<>>=
TukeyHSD(performance.3)
@ 

All three treatments are still significantly different, though B and C
are now only just, and the evidence is a lot weaker. Qualitatively,
this goes to show that if it makes a difference (as Skill does), it
should be in the model. Mathematically, Tukey from
\texttt{performance.2} is using errors from the model with Skill in
it, which are a lot smaller than the errors from the model without,
since knowing Skill helps a lot in predicting Performance.
  \end{solution}
