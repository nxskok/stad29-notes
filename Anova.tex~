\begin{slide}{Analysis of variance}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Analysis of variance used with:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item counted/measured response
    \item categorical explanatory variable(s)
    \item that is, data divided into groups, and see if response significantly different among groups
    \item or, see whether knowing group membership helps to predict response.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Typically two stages:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $F$-test to detect {\em any} differences among/due to groups
    \item if $F$-test significant, do {\em multiple comparisons} to see which groups significantly different from which.
    \item Need special multiple comparisons method because just doing (say) two-sample $t$-tests on each pair of groups gives too big a chance of finding ``signficant'' differences by accident.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{slide}{Example: jumping rats}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Link between exercise and healthy bones: exercise stresses bones and helps them grow stronger.
  \item Study assessed effect of jumping on bone density of rats. Rats randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item no jumping (control)
    \item low-jump (30 cm)
    \item high-jump (60 cm)
    \end{itemize}
  \item 8 jumps/day, 5 days/week, measure bone density (response) at end.
  \item PROC GLM to analyze (or PROC ANOVA, only works for balanced designs).
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{The data}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Some of the data (10 rats in each group). Data separated by tabs.
\begin{verbatim}
Control      1            603
Control      1            569
...
Lowjump      2            635
Lowjump      2            605
...
Highjump     3            643
Highjump     3            650
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Code}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Code below. Note format for reading tab-separated data.
\begin{verbatim}
options linesize=70;

data jumping;
  infile "jumping.dat" delimiter='09'x;
  input group $ g density;

proc means;
  var density;
  class group;

proc glm;
  class group;
  model density=group;
  means group / tukey;
  means group / bon;

\end{verbatim}


  \end{itemize}
  
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Comments}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item ``Straightforward'' one-way ANOVA.
  \item Tukey's method asks: ``how far apart might lowest and highest sample group means be, if population means all same?''. Anything larger than that declared significantly different.
  \item Bonferroni's method allows for number of paired comparisons, in general for $n$ groups is $n(n-1)/2$, here 3: divide $\alpha$ by 3 for each test (eg.\ $0.05/3=0.0167$). More ``conservative'' than Tukey.
  \end{itemize}

$F$-tests for model as a whole and for groups (same) significant: there is effect of jumping on bone density. Use multiple comparisons to see what.
