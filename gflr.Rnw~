\section{\texttt{gather}}

\texttt{gather} is a handy tool from the \texttt{tidyr} package that
is used for gathering up columns of a data frame that are not
variables in themselves but levels of a factor. This is an example:

<<>>=
d=data.frame(x=1:5,early=c(10,11,11,13,15),late=c(12,12,11,14,16))
d
@ 

Suppose \texttt{early} and \texttt{late} are a response
variable \texttt{y} that is measured early and late in the course of
the experiment. Then it would be better to have all the values in one
column \texttt{y} with a label \texttt{timepoint} that says whether
they were measured early or late. This is done with \texttt{gather}
like this:

<<>>=
d2=gather(d,timepoint,y,early:late)
d2
