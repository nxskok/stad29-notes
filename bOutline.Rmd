## Texts



* There is no official text for this course. 

* You may find "R for Data Science", 
[**link**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) helpful for R background.

* I will refer frequently to my book of Problems and Solutions in Applied Statistics (PASIAS), [**link**](http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/).

* Both of these resources are and will remain free.



## Programs, prerequisites and exclusions


* Prerequisites:


* For undergrads: STAC32. Not negotiable.

*  For grad students,
a first course in statistics, and some training in
regression and ANOVA. The less you know, the more you'll have to
catch up!


* This course is a required part of Applied Statistics minor.

* Exclusions: **this course is not for Math/Statistics/CS majors/minors**. 
It is for students in other
fields who wish to learn some more advanced statistical
methods. The exclusions in the Calendar reflect this. 

* If you
are in one of those programs, you won't get program credit for
this course, **or for any future STA courses you take.**


## Computing


* Computing: big part of the course, **not**
optional. You will need to demonstrate that you can use 
R to analyze data, and can
critically interpret the output.

* For grad students who have not come through STAC32, I am happy
to offer extra help to get you up to speed.


## Assessment 1/2


* Grading: (2 hour) midterm, (3 hour) final exam. Assignments most
weeks, due Tuesday at 11:59pm. 
Graduate students (STA 1007) also required to
complete a project using one or more of the techniques learned in
class, on a dataset from their field of study.    Projects due on
the last day of classes.


* Assessment:
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
& STAD29 & STA 1007\\
Assignments & 20\% & 20\%\\
Midterm exam & 30\%  & 20\% \\
Project & - & 20\%\\
Final exam & 50\% & 40\%
\end{tabular}

## Assessment 2/2

* Assessments missed *with documentation* will cause a
re-weighting of other assessments of same type. No make-ups.

* You **must pass the final exam** to guarantee passing the course. If you
fail the final exam but would otherwise have passed the course, you
receive a grade of 45.




## Plagiarism


* [**This link**](http://www.utoronto.ca/academicintegrity/academicoffenses.html)
defines academic offences at this university. Read it. You are bound by it. 

* Plagiarism defined (at the end) as

> The wrongful appropriation and purloining, and publication as oneâ€™s own, of the ideas, 
> or the expression of the ideas ... of another.

* The code and
explanations  that
you write and hand in must be *yours and yours alone*.

* When you hand in work, it is implied that it is
*your* work. Handing in work, with your name on it, that was actually done by
someone else is an *academic offence*.

* If I am suspicious
that anyone's work is plagiarized, I will take action.
