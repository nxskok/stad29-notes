Let me create some random data:

<<fig=T>>=
set.seed(457299)
x=rnorm(100,10,3)
boxplot(x)
@

This is normal data, so we're not expecting any serious outliers. The boxplot reveals two small outliers, one at each end. A summary of \texttt{x} looks like this:

<<>>=
summary(x)
@

These data were generated from a normal distribution, but how normal do they look? One answer is to get a histogram:

<<fig=TRUE>>=
hist(x)
@

and another is a normal quantile plot:

<<fig=TRUE>>=
qqnorm(x)
qqline(x)
@

These both look pretty normal, so the suggestion is that those outliers on the boxplot are not to be taken seriously.
