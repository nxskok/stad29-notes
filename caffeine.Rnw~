\question Does caffeine help students do better on a certain test? To
find out, 36 students were randomly allocated to three groups (12 in
each group).  Each student received a fixed number of cups of coffee
while they were studying, but the students didn't know whether they
were receiving all full-strength coffee (``high''), all decaf coffee
(``low'') or a 50-50 mixture of the two (``moderate''). For each
subject, their group was recorded as well as their score on the
test. The data are in
\url{http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/caffeine.csv}, as a
\texttt{.csv} file.

\begin{parts}
  \part Read in and examine the data. How are the values laid out?
  
  \begin{select}
  \begin{solution}
    \texttt{read.csv} because it's a \texttt{.csv} file:
    
<<>>=
caffeine.untidy=read.csv("caffeine.csv",header=T)
caffeine.untidy
@     

Or \texttt{head(caffeine.untidy)}, but I listed the whole thing since there's
not too many values.

The first column is the number of the subject (actually within each
group, since each student only tried one amount of caffeine). Then
follow the test scores for the students in each group, one group per column.

I gave the data frame a kind of dumb name, since (looking ahead) I
could see that I would need a less-dumb name for the tidied-up data,
and it seemed sensible to keep \texttt{caffeine} for that.
  \end{solution}
    
  \end{select}
  
  \part Explain briefly how the data are not ``tidy''.

  \begin{select}
  \begin{solution}
    The last three columns are all scores on the test: that is, they
    all measure the same thing, so they should all be in the same column.
  \end{solution}
    
  \end{select}
  
  \part Use a suitable tool from \texttt{tidyr} to create one
  column of test scores and and one column of group labels. Call your
  column of group labels \texttt{amount} and make sure that it is an R \texttt{factor}.
  
  \begin{select}
  \begin{solution}
    We are combining several columns into one, so this is \texttt{gather}:
    
<<>>=
library(tidyr)
caffeine=gather(caffeine.untidy,amount,score,c(High,Moderate,None))
@     

I didn't ask you to list the resulting data frame, but it is smart to
at least look at the \texttt{head} or \texttt{str} of it, to make sure \texttt{gather} has done
what you expected.

In fact, looking at the \texttt{str} reveals that we forgot something:

<<>>=
str(caffeine)
@ 

\texttt{amount} is text, not a factor, which is not what we wanted.
So we should go back and put in \verb-factor_key-:

<<>>=
caffeine=gather(caffeine.untidy,amount,score,c(High,Moderate,None),
  factor_key=T)
str(caffeine)
@ 

Now we are good.

The logic here is that \texttt{gather} needs a data frame (unless you
are using it in a chain), what makes the columns-to-be-combined
different (they're different amounts of caffeine), what makes them the
same (they're all test scores), and then the columns to combine,
without quotes.
  \end{solution}
    
  \end{select}
  
  \part Obtain side-by-side boxplots of test scores by amount of caffeine.
  
  \begin{select}
  \begin{solution}
<<filton>>=
attach(caffeine)
boxplot(score~amount)
@     

Or if you want to try \texttt{ggplot}:

<<>>=
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(caffeine,aes(x=amount,y=score))+geom_boxplot()
@ 

  \end{solution}
    
  \end{select}

  \part Does caffeine amount seem to have an effect? If so, what
  kind of effect?
  
  \begin{select}
  \begin{solution}
    On average, exam scores seem to be higher when the amount of
    caffeine is higher (with
    the effect being particularly pronounced for High caffeine). 
    
    If you want to, you can also say the the effect of caffeine seems
    to be small, relative to the amount of variability there is (there
    is a lot). The point is that you say \emph{something} supported by
    the boxplot.
  \end{solution}
    
  \end{select}
  
  \part Run a suitable analysis of variance to determine whether
  the mean test score is equal or unequal for the three groups. What
  do you conclude?

  \begin{select}
  \begin{solution}
    Something like this:
<<>>=
caff.1=aov(score~amount)
summary(caff.1)
@     

The P-value on the $F$-test is less than 0.05, so we reject the null
hypothesis (which says that all the groups have equal means) in favour
of the alternative: the group means are not all the same (one or more
of them is different from the others).


  \end{solution}
    
  \end{select}
  
  \part Why is it a good idea to run Tukey's method here?
  
  \begin{select} 
  \begin{solution}
    The analysis of variance $F$-test is significant, so that the
    groups are not all the same. Tukey's method will tell us which
    group(s) differ(s) from the others. There are three groups, so
    there are differences to find that we don't know about yet.
  \end{solution}
   
  \end{select}
  
  \part Run Tukey's method. What do you conclude?
  
  \begin{select}
  \begin{solution}
This kind of thing:

<<>>=
caff.3=TukeyHSD(caff.1)
caff.3
@ 

The high-caffeine group definitely has a higher mean test score than
the no-caffeine group. (The Moderate group is not significantly
different from either of the other groups.)

You might find that a plot of the \texttt{TukeyHSD} object (though I
didn't ask for it) sheds some light:

<<bedminster>>=
plot(caff.3)
@ 

The group-comparison labels might have gotten messed up, but both the
comparisons involving Moderate could go either way (the interval for
the difference in means includes zero). The No-High comparison, 
however, is away from zero, so this is the significant one. As is
usual, we are pretty sure that the difference in means (this way
around) is negative, but we are not at all clear about how big it is. 
\end{solution}
    
  \end{select}
\end{parts}


\question Let's look again at the caffeine data, but this time look at
contrasts. Suppose I knew ahead of time
that I wanted to compare moderate caffeine with high, and any
caffeine with none. (In the latter case, we're comparing ``no
caffeine'' against the average of the other two groups.)

\begin{parts}
  
  \part Using the tidied caffeine data, run the ANOVA \emph{as a
    regression} (that is, using ANOVA). Look at the \texttt{summary}
  of the output. What do you see?
  
  \begin{select}
    \begin{solution}
<<>>=
caffeine.2=lm(score~amount,data=caffeine)
summary(caffeine.2)
@       
Look at the slopes. They are \texttt{amount} followed by one of the
amounts of caffeine. R is using ``high'' as a baseline  (that's the
first level alphabetically), so the
\texttt{amountModerate} line is testing high vs.\ moderate: high is
\emph{not} significantly higher, in terms of test scores, than
moderate. That's one of the things I wanted to test. What about the
coefficient for \texttt{amountNone}? That's none vs.\ \emph{high},
since high was the baseline. This is, as we saw from Tukey,
significant. But it is not what I said we wanted to test. 

\end{solution}
  \end{select}
  
  \part Obtain the levels of the factor \texttt{amount}, in the order
  that R has them.
  
  \begin{select}
    \begin{solution}
<<>>=
levels(amount)
@ 

Or just print the whole thing and look at the  end:

<<>>=
amount
@ 

High, Moderate and None in that order. These happen to be in
alphabetical order, but that's not the reason they came out that
way. They did so because columns of those names were in the original
data file in that order, and when we used \texttt{gather} with
\verb-factor_key=T-, we created a factor \texttt{amount} with those
levels in that order.

    \end{solution}
  \end{select}

  \part Create a contrast that compares High with Moderate, ignoring
  None. That is, create a vector whose length is the same as the
  number of levels of \texttt{amount}, and which has a 1 to represent
  High and a $-1$ to represent Moderate. (What do you think will be
  the effect of ignoring None?)
  
  \begin{select}
    \begin{solution}
      Put a 0 in for None:
<<>>=
c.hm=c(1,-1,0)
@       

Having the 1 and the $-1$ the other way around is also fine.
    \end{solution}
  \end{select}
  
  \part Create a contrast that compares ``any caffeine'' against
  ``none'' by comparing None against the average of Moderate and High.
  
  \begin{select}
    \begin{solution}
<<>>=
c.any=c(-0.5,-0.5,1)
@ 
     
Note that both our contrasts have coefficients that add up to zero:

<<>>=
sum(c.hm)
sum(c.any)
@ 
    \end{solution}
  \end{select}
  
  \part Verify that your two contrasts are orthogonal.
  
  \begin{select}
    \begin{solution}
      Multiply them together and check that what you get adds up to zero:
      
<<>>=
c.hm*c.any
@       

(it does) or save a little mental processing by having R work out the sum too:

<<>>=
sum(c.hm*c.any)
@ 

Zero, so orthogonal.

    \end{solution}
  \end{select}
  
  \part Arrange your contrasts as columns of a matrix (using
  \texttt{cbind}), and say that you want to use these as contrasts for \texttt{amount}.
  
  \begin{select}
    \begin{solution}
<<>>=
m=cbind(c.hm,c.any)
contrasts(amount)=m
@ 
      
    \end{solution}
  \end{select}
  
  \part Fit the ANOVA as an \texttt{lm}, and look at the
  \texttt{summary}. What do you conclude about your contrasts?
  
  \begin{select}
    \begin{solution}
<<>>=
caff.3=lm(score~amount)
summary(caff.3)
@ 

\texttt{c.hm} was the contrast between high and moderate
caffeine. This is not significant (P-value 0.142), which is the same
conclusion as Tukey, but the P-value here is quite a bit lower (and
thus closer to being significant). There's a reason for that: here we
are focusing in on the two contrasts that we really wanted to test,
and ignoring the $F$-test and the Tukey that tell us stuff that we
don't care about. By focusing our comparison, we get a better
(smaller) P-value.

\texttt{c.any} was none vs.\ average of any
caffeine. This one is significant, with a P-value of 0.023. So this
contrast tells us that having any caffeine is better than having none.

    \end{solution}
  \end{select}
  
  \part What happens if you try to use high caffeine vs.\ moderate
  caffeine and moderate vs.\ none as your two contrasts?
  
  \begin{select}
    \begin{solution}
<<>>=
c.hm=c(1,-1,0)
c.mn=c(0,1,-1)
@ 

So far so good: the coefficients add up to zero and they reflect the
right comparisons. But now:

<<>>=
c.hm*c.mn
@ 

This does \emph{not} add up to zero, so these two contrasts are not
orthogonal, and we can't do what we just did. R will give us an answer
if we try it, but it'll be the \emph{wrong} answer.\endnote{SAS, for example,
has a way of making non-orthogonal contrasts orthogonal in a way that
the user doesn't have to worry about, but in R, you are ``closer to
the ground'' and you have to make it happen yourself.}

The best
description I have seen of what to do here is by David Howell\endnote{the author of a famous
text on Statistics in Psychology}, at
\url{https://www.uvm.edu/~dhowell/StatPages/More_Stuff/R/AnovaOneway.html}
(at the bottom).
Let
me try to follow his method. 

First we need a vector that is all 1's, which I have called
\texttt{c0} below. Since each of our contrasts \texttt{c.hm} and
\texttt{c.mn} have 3 things in them (3 groups), we need to add a
``dummy'' 3rd contrast to give us a $3\times 3$ array of numbers:\endnote{which we are going to invert, as a matrix. But I get ahead of myself.}

<<>>=
c0=rep(1,3)
m=cbind(c0,c.hm,c.mn)
m
@ 

This is what Howell calls an ``augmented'' matrix of contrasts, since
it has our two contrasts as the second and third columns, plus
the extra dummy one. Next we invert this matrix of contrasts,
which we can do because it's square. \texttt{t(m)} means ``take the
matrix transpose of \texttt{m}'', if you're trying to keep up at the
back, and \texttt{solve} finds a matrix inverse:

<<>>=
minv=solve(t(m))
@ 

and then we remove the first column, which represents the contrast
that we didn't want anyway (what Howell calls ``deaugmenting''):

<<>>=
m.contr=minv[,-1]
m.contr
contrasts(amount)=m.contr
@ 

The columns of \texttt{m.contr} are our new made-orthogonal contrasts.


Now fit the model again:

<<>>=
caff.4=lm(score~amount)
summary(caff.4)
@ 

The rows \texttt{amountc.hm} and \texttt{amountc.mn} are the proper tests
for our contrasts \texttt{c.hm} and \texttt{c.mn}. \texttt{c.hm} was ``high
vs.\ moderate'', which is not significant (P-value 0.14) and
\texttt{c.mn} was ``moderate vs.\ none'', which is not significant either
(P-value 0.20). This is the same significance as from Tukey, but note
that the P-values for the non-significant tests are much lower than
the corresponding ones from Tukey, once again because we have focused
on just these comparisons, and not on any others. We decided ahead of
time to test just these.


Finally, this:

<<>>=
detach(caffeine)
@ 

since I have a variable called \texttt{score} in another question as
well, and I don't want to get them mixed up.

    \end{solution}
  \end{select}
  
\end{parts}
