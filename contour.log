You are running SAS 9. Some SAS 8 files will be automatically converted 
by the V9 engine; others are incompatible.  Please see

PROC MIGRATE will preserve current SAS file attributes and is 
recommended for converting all your SAS libraries from any 
SAS 8 release to SAS 9.  For details and examples, please see

NOTE: The contour level 0 is less than the lowest value of the variable z, which is 2.087523E-28.
NOTE: Some labeling attempts for contour level 20 failed.
NOTE: Some labeling attempts for contour level 50 failed.
NOTE: Some labeling attempts for contour level 100 failed.
NOTE: Some labeling attempts for contour level 200 failed.
NOTE: Some labeling attempts for contour level 400 failed.
NOTE: Some labeling attempts for contour level 800 failed.
NOTE: More labels may be produced by reducing potential label collisions and by increasing the proportion of usable contours. 
      Collisions may be reduced by decreasing the label size via the H= symbol statement option or by softening label collision 
      checking with AUTOLABEL=(CHECK=), or setting it to NONE. More contour curves can be qualified for labeling attempts by 
      increasing the AUTOLABEL=(TOLANGLE=) angle as well.
