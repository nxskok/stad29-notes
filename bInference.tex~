\begin{frame}{The statistical world}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 
  Consists of:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item objects or people of interest to us ({\em individuals})
  \item things measured or counted on those individuals ({\em variables})
  \end{itemize}

\pause

\item About the individuals:

\begin{itemize}
\item which ones do we care about? All of them, the {\em population}.
\item which ones do we know about? The ones we happened to look at, the {\em sample}.
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Sample is (or should be) randomly chosen from population, with no favoritism.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sample to population: confidence interval}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 
Want to know about population (parameter), but don't. Only have sample (statistic). Eg.\ population mean, only have sample mean.
\item Logic:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\em If} we knew about population, could figure out kinds of samples that might appear (math).
  \item In particular, can figure how far apart sample statistic and population parameter might be.
  \item Use this to construct {\em confidence interval} for population parameter: says eg.\ ``based on my sample, I think population mean between $a$ and $b$''. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Test of significance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Or: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 
might have theory leading to {\em null hypothesis} (eg.\ population mean is 20) and {\em alternative hypothesis} (eg.\ population mean not 20).
\item This leads to {\em test of significance} (hypothesis test): ``based on my sample, I think pop.\ mean is (is not) 20''
\item Done by choosing $\alpha$ (eg.\ 0.05), calculating {\em test statistic} and {\em P-value}. If P-value $< \alpha$, {\em reject null}: have evidence in favour of alternative.
  \end{itemize}
\item Math producing inference procedures can be difficult, but calculations (with software) and interpretations need not be.
  \end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exploratory data analysis}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sometimes don't have theory (yet), just want to see what data
    tell us.
  \item Use graphs, simple descriptive statistics, some of methods we learn.
  \item Idea: generate ideas (``hypotheses'') for future study.
  \item Cannot make clear conclusions about populations.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The Degree of Reading Power data}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Have new method for teaching reading.
  \item Want to see if better than ``standard'' method (``research hypothesis'').
  \item Design: randomly allocate available children to ``treatment''
    (new method) or ``control'' (standard).
  \item Measure score for all children on standard reading test.
  \item Analysis: is observed difference between treatment/control score
    means big enough to be real not chance? Do 2-sample $t$-test.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Some of the data}

\begin{verbatim}
t 43
t 53
t 57
t 49
t 56
t 33
c 42
c 33
c 46
c 37
c 43
\end{verbatim}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item 1st column label (``t'' for treatment, ``c'' for control).
  \item 2nd column response (score on reading test).
  \item Data in plain text file \verb-drp.dat-.

  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Writing a SAS program}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item 2 parts: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item read data into SAS (DATA step)
    \item tell SAS what to do with data (PROC step)
    \end{itemize}
  \item DATA step, basic format 1 obs per row, each word/number a
    variable (separated by whitespace).
  \item This reads DRP data:

\begin{verbatim}
data drp;
  infile "drp.dat";
  input group $ score;
\end{verbatim}
  \item Data in file \verb-drp.dat-; 2 variables, "group" 
    (text), score (number).
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The SAS PROC step}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item SAS has {\em many} procedures for doing things with data. We
    look at 3:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item PROC PRINT simply lists data values
    \item PROC MEANS computes means and SDs for variables given
    \item PROC TTEST does 1- and 2-sample $t$ tests
    \end{itemize}
  \item Add PROC steps plus options to file containing data step. Here
    PROC MEANS and PROC TTEST have same options: ``class'' is variable
    splitting data into groups, ``var'' is (response) variable:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
proc means;
  class group;
  var score;

proc ttest;
  class group;
  var score;
\end{verbatim}
}

  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The whole thing}

\begin{columns}

\column{0.5\textwidth}

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
options linesize=80;

data drp;
  infile "drp.dat";
  input group $ score;

proc print;

proc means;
  class group;
  var score;

proc ttest;
  class group;
  var score;

run;
\end{verbatim}
}

\column{0.5\textwidth}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item I like to indent lines belonging to each step and leave blank
    line between steps.
  \item (Optionally) Save in file like ``drp.sas''.

  \end{itemize}

\end{columns}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{To run SAS}

Submit this program (Run, Submit).

To see if it worked, look at Log window. Any lines beginning
\verb-ERROR:- are things needing to be fixed. Go to Program Editor,
select Run, Recall Last Submit.
Fix errors,
submit again.

Things like this indicate success:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
NOTE: 44 records were read from the infile "drp.dat".
      The minimum record length was 6.
      The maximum record length was 6.
NOTE: The data set WORK.DRP has 44 observations and 2 variables.

NOTE: The PROCEDURE PRINT printed page 1.

NOTE: The PROCEDURE MEANS printed page 2.

NOTE: The PROCEDURE TTEST printed page 3.
\end{verbatim}

\item Page 1 just a listing of data.

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item SAS does 2 $t$ procedures:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Pooled: assumes 2 population variances/SDs are same
    \item Satterthwaite: does not, but only approximation.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Sample SDs quite different, suggests use of Satterthwaite.
  \item For test: look at P-value 0.0264. Less than 0.05, so have
    evidence of difference in mean test scores between reading methods.
  \item Satterthwaite CI for difference in means $-18.7$ to $-1.2$
    (control minus treatment): treatment better.
  \item P-values for Satterthwaite vs.\ pooled very close (0.0286 and
    0.0264), so conclusion not affected by choice of test.
  \item Last test for equality of variances/SDs between 2
    groups. P-value 0.0507 very close to significance, supporting use
    of Satterthwaite.
  \end{itemize}
