\section{R Scripts, projects and R Markdown: 
organizing your work}
\frame{\sectionpage}

\begin{frame}[frame]{R Scripts}


* Typing commands in the bottom left Console window is OK, but:


* may need to type commands over again

* can use up/down arrows to scroll through previous commands

* no easy record of what you did.


* File/New/R Script opens new window top left.

* enter commands *here*, control-enter or Run button runs
them (output in console).

* select several lines, Run runs all.

* **Have record of what you did**.

* Editable: can save list of working commands, with no false
trails, re-run from start to check analysis reproducible.



## Projects


* Provides a way of putting code and data in one place.

* One overarching structure: can have scripts, text windows,
etc. all open in one place.

* When you close a project and re-open it, code and data are as
you left it.

* To create a project, Project-Create Project. Project
associated with folder (directory). Prompted to create new project
in new folder, or associate it with existing folder.

* Then browse to folder where you want the project, and click
Create Project.

* Can have different projects for eg. each assignment, to keep
them separate.

* Helps solve "folder problem", because everything in Project folder.



## R Markdown


* Reproducible research: anyone should be able to reproduce
exactly the analysis you did.

* Report and analysis combined (instead of copy-pasting).

* Report uses "markup language" (simplified HTML) for text
and formatting.

* To add code, insert *code chunk*.

* Inside code chunk, put *only* code. This is run when
document is processed, and output inserted in final document.



## Example R Markdown document

{\scriptsize  

```

This is the title
=================
Here is some data:

```{r}
x=c(10,11,13,14,17,18,22,24,27,41)
x
```

and this is a summary of x:

```{r}
summary(x)
```

Finally, a boxplot of x:

```{r}
boxplot(x)
```

from which we see that x is right-skewed.

```

}


## How it looks when "knitted", some
It falls off the bottom of the page:

## Doing it yourself


* File-New-R Notebook, pops up new window top left with template.

* Save it (just filename, R supplies extension).

* Write your report/assignment, inserting formatting code.

* Insert code chunk by Chunks, Insert Chunk (control-alt-i).

* In code chunk, just put the code you want to run. Can produce
text or graphics output.

* To see how each chunk's output looks, click green arrow top
right of chunk

* To see how it all looks, click Preview. Preview window pops up.

* If you don't like it, edit R Markdown and preview again.



## When you're happy with it


* Find arrow to right of Preview. Click it. In drop-down, select
Knit to Word. This will produce Word copy of text plus code plus
output, suitable for handing in as assignment.

* If you see any errors, *close* Word, go back to R
Markdown, make changes and knit again.

* You can make final cosmetic changes to the Word (eg. put
tables in fixed-width font so that they line up), but if you
change the R code and knit again, *those changes will be lost*.

* You can also knit to PDF, but that requires \LaTeX\ on your
computer. 
 ## Tidying data
   
   
   
* Most of this from
     [link](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html). 
   
* Data don't often come to us in the format that we would like
     them for analysis.
   
* Often, columns should be rows (or vice versa), or columns
     should be combined or split.
   
* Guiding principle (for us): every value belongs to a *variable*
     and an *observation*:
     
     
*     A variable contains all values that
     measure the same thing (eg. height)
   
* An observation contains all values measured on the same
     subject (eg. person.)
   
* Each variable is in a column.
   
* Each observation is in one, or more than one, row.
     
     
   
   
 
 
 ## The usual beginning
 <<>>=
 library(tidyverse)
 @   
   
 
 
 ## One variable in multiple columns
 <<message=F>>=
 scores=read_delim("scores.txt"," ")
 scores
 @   
 
 
 
* `assgt.1` through `test.2` are all the same thing
   (scores on an assessment). Combine them into *one* column, with
   a label showing which assessment they belong to. 
    
 
 
 
 ## `gather`
 
   
 <<size="scriptsize">>=
 library(tidyverse)
 scores2 = scores %>% 
     gather(assessment,score,assgt.1:test.2)
 scores2
 @   
 
 Now can find mean score on each assessment, or make boxplots of scores
 for each assessment (side by side). 
 
 
 ## Anatomy of `gather`
   
   Gather requires three things:
   
   
* What makes the columns different
   
* What makes the columns the same (what the columns to be combined
     are all instances of)
   
* Which columns to "gather" together. Can be `x:y`
     meaning columns `x` through `y` inclusive, or a
     vector of column names with `c()`, or column names to omit
     with `-`. No quotes needed in column names.
   
   
 
 
 ## Splitting things up
   
 Suppose we want to split up that `assessment` column into two
 things': the assessment type `assess.type` and which number
 assessment it is `assess.num`. That is a job for `separate`:
 
 {\footnotesize
 <<>>=
 separate(scores2,assessment,
          into=c("assess.type","assess.num"),
          sep="\\.")
 @ 
 }
   
 
 
 
 ## Chaining things together
   
   To do `gather` and `separate` in sequence, use pipe
   `%>%`, "and then".
 
 <<size="footnotesize">>=
 scores %>% 
     gather(assessment,score,assgt.1:test.2) %>%
     separate(assessment,into=c("assess.type","assess.num"), 
       sep="\\.")
 @   
   
 
 
 
 ## Anatomy of `separate`
   
   This too needs three things:
   
   
   
* a variable `x` to separate out into parts
   
* a thing `into`: a vector of variable names to separate
     `x` into
   
* a thing `sep` to specify what to separate on. This is a
     "regular expression": the odd-looking code we used means
     "separate by dot", but a dot in a regular expression means ``any
     one character'', and we want an actual dot.
     
     `sep` can also be a number, which means ``separate after
     that many characters from the beginning''. Here, though, the dot
     could be anywhere, so we separate at the dot, wherever it is.
   
   
   
 
 
 ## The weather data
   
 <<>>=
 weather=read_delim("weather.txt"," ")
 @   
   
 
 
 
 ## Making separate columns
   
 We have:
   
 <<>>=
 weather
 @   
 
   
 
 
 ## `spread`
 
 `temperature` is certainly temperature, but `type`
 is two kinds of temperature: daily maximum and 
 daily minimum. Two separate variables, and thus need to be
 in two separate columns. Inverse of `gather`:
 
 <<>>=
 weather %>% spread(type,temperature)
 @ 
 
 `spread` needs two things: the variable for dividing into
 groups (used as names for new variables), and the variable to be
 divided. 
 
 
 
 
 ## `dplyr: doing things to tidy data frames`
   
   Real-life data frames, even after tidying, don't always  contain
   what we want. `dplyr` helps to "bash things into shape":
   
   
   
* Choosing rows (observations) (`filter`)
   
* Sorting rows by variables (`arrange`)
   
* Choosing columns (variables) (`select`)
   
* Creating new variables (`mutate`)
   
* Summarizing variables (`summarize`)
   
* Randomly sampling rows (`sample_n` and `sample_frac`)
   
   
   This based on [link](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html).
 
 
 
 
 
 ## Choosing rows (1)
   
   Start with somewhat-tidy marks data frame:
   
 <<>>=
 scores2
 @   
 
   
   
 
 
 ## Choosing rows (2)
   
   To choose just Angela's marks (note `==`):
   
 <<size="small">>=
 scores2 %>% filter(name=="Angela")
 @   
 
 or just Angela's test 1 mark ("and" implied):
 
 <<size="footnotesize">>=
 scores2 %>% 
     filter(name=="Angela",assessment=="test.1")
 @ 
   
 
 
 ## Choosing rows (3)
   
 Choose marks which belong either to assignment 1 or to test 1:
 
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% 
     filter(assessment=="assgt.1" | 
            assessment=="test.1")
 @ 
   
 
 
 ## Choosing rows (4)
   
 The marks that are over 40:
 
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% filter(score>40)
 @ 
   
 
 
 ## Ordering rows (1)
   
 To sort rows into order (by one or more variables), use `arrange`:
 
 {\small
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% arrange(name)
 @ 
 }
   
 
 
 ## Ordering rows (2)
   
 In descending order:
 
 {\small
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% arrange(desc(score))
 @ 
 }
   
 
 
 
 ## Ordering rows (3)
   
 By name, breaking ties in descending order of score:
 
 {\small
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% arrange(name,desc(score))
 @ 
 }
   
 
 
 ## Choosing columns
 
   
   
*   `select` chooses columns. You choose columns the same way as
   in `gather`.
   
 
* *But*, `MASS` also has a `select` (that does
   something different). So if you did `library(MASS)` in this R
   session, "unattach" it first:
   
 <<eval=F>>=
 detach("package:MASS", unload=T)
 @   
 
     
 
   
   
 
 
 ## Choosing columns (variables) (1)
 
   
   
* Now, for
   example, to pull out just the marks (only the top few fit on the screen):
 
 <<size="footnotesize">>=
 scores2 %>% select(score)
 @   
   
   
 
 
 ## Choosing columns (variables) (2)
   
   And to pull out everything but the names:
   
 <<size="footnotesize">>=
 scores2 %>% select(-name)
 @   
   
 
 
 ## Selecting columns (variables) (3)
   
 Or, choose "assessment through score":
   
 <<size="footnotesize">>=
 scores2 %>% select(assessment:score)
 @   
   
 
 
 ## Chaining things together
   
   These functions can also be chained together in sequence. Again,
   remove the first data frame argument to any of the functions. Thus,
   to choose everything but name and display the first 5 rows of result:
 
 <<size="footnotesize">>=
 scores2 %>% select(-name) %>% head(5)
 @ 
   
 
 
 ## Finding the different ones: `distinct`
   
   ``What are the different
   assessments?'' Easiest done in a chain:
   
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% select(assessment) %>% distinct() 
 @   
   
 
 
 ## What does this one do?
   
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% select(-name) %>% head(5) %>% 
   distinct()
 @ 
   
 This shows the distinct assessment-score patterns (several people had
 the same score on the same assessment, so even though we looked at the
 top 5 lines of the result, several of them were identical, so we only
 got 3 distinct ones).
   
 
 
 
 ## Creating new columns using `mutate`
   
   Suppose the assignment is out of 10, the tests are out of 50, and we
   want to create a new column that is percentages:
   
   {\small
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% mutate(out.of=c(rep(10,4),rep(50,8)),
                    percent=score/out.of*100)
 @   
 }
   
 
 
 ## Summarizing values
   
   Use `summarize` (or `summarise`):
   
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% summarize(mean.score=mean(score))
 @   
 
 Not useful yet, but very useful in making summaries by group (later).
   
 
 
 ## Random samples of rows
   
 <<echo=F>>=
 set.seed(457299)
 @   
 
 By the number of rows you want:
 
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% sample_n(5)
 @ 
   
 
 
 ## Random samples of rows (part 2)
   
 
 or the fraction of rows you want:
 
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% sample_frac(0.25)
 @ 
   
 
 
 
 ## Doing things by groups
   
   Start with `group_by`. Then use `summarize()` or
   whatever as needed. This seems to work most naturally in a chain.
   
   To find the mean score on each assessment:
   
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% group_by(assessment) %>% 
    summarize( assess.mean=mean(score),
               assess.sd=sd(score)
             )
 @   
   
 
 
 ## How many assessments did each person do?
   
 <<>>=
 scores2 %>% group_by(name) %>%
    dplyr::summarize(how.many=n())
 @   
   
 
 This is actually ``how many times did each name appear in the original
 data frame?''.
