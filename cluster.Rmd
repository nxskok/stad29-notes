# Cluster analysis



## Cluster Analysis

  
  - One side-effect of discriminant analysis: could draw picture of data (if 1st 2s `LD`s told most of story) and see which individuals "close" to each other.
  - Discriminant analysis requires knowledge of groups.
  - Without knowledge of groups, use *cluster analysis*: see which individuals close, which groups suggested by data.
  - Idea: see how individuals group into "clusters" of nearby individuals.
  - Base on "dissimilarities" between individuals.
  - Or base on standard deviations and correlations between variables (assesses dissimilarity behind scenes).

## Dissimilarities and languages example

  
  - Can define dissimilarities how you like (whatever makes sense in application).
  - Sometimes defining "similarity" makes more sense; can turn this into dissimilarity by subtracting from some maximum.
  - Example: numbers 1--10 in various European languages. Define
    similarity between two languages by counting how often the same
    number has a name starting with the same letter (and dissimilarity
    by how often number has names starting with different letter).
  - Crude (doesn't even look at most of the words), but see how effective.
  
  


## Two kinds of cluster analysis

  
  - Looking at process of forming clusters (of similar languages):
    \textbf{hierarchical cluster analysis} (`hclust`).
    
    - Start with each individual in cluster by itself.
    - Join "closest" clusters one by one until all individuals in one cluster.
    - How to define closeness of two *clusters*? Not obvious,
      investigate in a moment.
    
  - Know how many clusters: which division into that many clusters
    is "best" for individuals? \textbf{K-means clustering} (`kmeans`).
  
  


## Two made-up clusters
  
```{r}
set.seed(457299)
a=data.frame(x=runif(5,0,20),y=runif(5,0,20))
b=data.frame(x=runif(5,20,40),y=runif(5,20,40))
ddd=bind_rows(a=a,b=b,.id="cluster")
g=ggplot(ddd,aes(x=x,y=y,colour=cluster))+geom_point()+
  coord_fixed(xlim=c(0,40),ylim=c(0,40))
g
```   

How to measure distance between set of red points and set of blue
ones? 
  


## Single-linkage distance
  
  Find the red point and the blue point that are closest together:
  
```{r}
distance=function(p1,p2) {
  as.numeric(sqrt((p1[1]-p2[1])^2+(p1[2]-p2[2])^2))
}
distances=matrix(0,nrow(a),nrow(b))
for (i in 1:nrow(a)) {
  for (j in 1:nrow(b)) {
    dd=distance(a[i,],b[j,])
    distances[i,j]=dd
  }
}
wm1=which.min(apply(distances,1,min))
wm2=which.min(apply(distances,2,min))
closest=bind_rows(a=a[wm1,],b=b[wm2,],.id="cluster")
# single linkage distance
g+geom_segment(data=closest,aes(x=x[1],y=y[1],xend=x[2],yend=y[2]),colour="blue")
```   

Single-linkage distance between 2 clusters is distance between their
closest points.
  


## Complete linkage
  
  Find the red and blue points that are farthest apart:
  
```{r}
wm1=which.max(apply(distances,1,max))
wm2=which.max(apply(distances,2,max))
closest=bind_rows(a[wm1,],b[wm2,],.id="cluster")
g+geom_segment(data=closest,aes(x=x[1],y=y[1],xend=x[2],yend=y[2]),colour="blue")
```

Complete-linkage distance is distance between farthest points. 
  


## Ward's method
  
  Work out mean of each cluster and join point to its mean:
  
```{r}
xm=aggregate(x~cluster,ddd,mean)
ym=aggregate(y~cluster,ddd,mean)
dm=cbind(xm,y=ym[,2])
# loop through data frame and create grp that links to cluster's mean
new=data.frame(x=double(),y=double(),cluster=character(),grp=integer(),
  stringsAsFactors = F)
count=0;
for (i in 1:5) {
  count=count+1
  new[2*count-1,]=c(a[i,],cluster="a",grp=count)
  new[2*count,]=c(dm[1,-1],cluster="a",grp=count)
  count=count+1
  new[2*count-1,]=c(b[i,],cluster="b",grp=count)
  new[2*count,]=c(dm[2,-1],cluster="b",grp=count)
}
ggplot(ddd,aes(x=x,y=y,colour=cluster))+
  coord_fixed(xlim=c(0,40),ylim=c(0,40))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_point(data=dm,shape=3)+
  geom_line(data=new,aes(group=grp),alpha=0.5)
```   

(i) Work out sum of squared distances of points from means.


## Ward's method part 2
  
Now imagine combining the two clusters and working out overall
mean. Join each point to this mean:

```{r}
ddd %>% summarize(x=mean(x),y=mean(y)) -> dm
# loop through data frame and create grp that links to cluster's mean
new=data.frame(x=double(),y=double(),cluster=character(),grp=integer(),
  stringsAsFactors = F)
count=0;
for (i in 1:5) {
  count=count+1
  new[2*count-1,]=c(a[i,],cluster="a",grp=count)
  new[2*count,]=c(dm[1,],cluster="a",grp=count)
  count=count+1
  new[2*count-1,]=c(b[i,],cluster="b",grp=count)
  new[2*count,]=c(dm[1,],cluster="b",grp=count)
}
ggplot(ddd,aes(x=x,y=y,colour=cluster))+
  coord_fixed(xlim=c(0,40),ylim=c(0,40))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_point(data=dm,aes(colour=NULL),shape=3)+
  geom_line(data=new,aes(group=grp),alpha=0.5)
```   
(ii) Calc sum of squared distances of points to combined mean.
  


## Ward's method part 3
  
  
  - (ii) will be bigger than (i) (points closer to own cluster
    mean than combined mean).
  - Ward's distance is (ii) minus (i).
  - Think of as "cost" of combining clusters:
    
    - if clusters close together, (ii) only a little larger than
      (i)
    - if clusters far apart, (ii) a lot larger than (i) (as in
      example). 
    
  
  


## Hierarchical clustering revisited
  
  
  - Single linkage, complete linkage, Ward are ways of measuring
    closeness of clusters.
  - Use them, starting with each observation in own cluster, to
    repeatedly combine two closest clusters until all points in one
    cluster.
  - They will give different answers (clustering stories). 
  - Single linkage tends to make "stringy" clusters because
    clusters can be very different apart from two closest points.
  - Complete linkage insists on whole clusters being similar.
  - Ward tends to form many small clusters first.
  
  


## Dissimilarity data in R


Dissimilarities for language data\label{p:numberd} were how many
number names had *different* first letter:

```{r}
options(width=60)
``` 

```{r}
my_url="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/languages.txt"
number.d=read_table(my_url)
number.d
``` 



## Making a distance object
  
```{r}
d = number.d %>% 
    select(-la) %>%
    as.dist()
d
class(d)
```   
  


## Cluster analysis and dendrogram
  
```{r}
d.hc=hclust(d,method="single")
plot(d.hc)
```   
  


## Comments
  
  
  - Tree shows how languages combined into clusters.
  - First (bottom), Spanish, French, Italian joined into one
    cluster, Norwegian and Danish into another.
  - Later, English joined to Norse languages, Polish to Romance group.
  - Then German, Dutch make a Germanic group.
  - Finally, Hungarian and Finnish joined to each other and
    everything else.
  
  


## Clustering process

  


  
```{r}
d.hc$labels
d.hc$merge
``` 

  
  
    
    
- Lines of `merge` show what was combined
    - First, languages 2 and 3 (`no` and `dk`)
    - Then languages 6 and 8 (`fr` and `it`)
    - Then \#7 combined with cluster formed at step 2 (`es`
      joined to `fr` and `it`).
    - Then `en` joined to `no` and `dk` ...
    - Finally `fi` joined to all others.
    
  



## Complete linkage
  
```{r}
d.hc=hclust(d,method="complete")
plot(d.hc)
```  
  


## Ward
  
```{r}
d.hc=hclust(d,method="ward.D")
plot(d.hc)
```   
  


## Chopping the tree

  
  - Three clusters (from Ward) looks good:
```{r}
cutree(d.hc,3)
```     
  
  


## Drawing those clusters on the tree
  
```{r}
plot(d.hc)
rect.hclust(d.hc,3)
```   
  


## Comparing single-linkage and Ward

  
  - In Ward, Dutch and German get joined earlier (before joining to Germanic cluster).
  - Also Hungarian and Finnish get combined earlier.
  
  



## Making those dissimilarities

Original data:

```{r}
options(width=60)
```  


```{r}
my_url="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/one-ten.txt"
lang=read_delim(my_url," ")
lang 
``` 

It would be a lot easier to extract the first letter if the number
names were all in one column.
  


## Tidy, and extract first letter
  
```{r}
lang.long = lang %>% mutate(number=row_number()) %>%
    gather(language,name,-number) %>%
    mutate(first=str_sub(name,1,1))
lang.long %>% print(n=12)
```   
  


## Calculating dissimilarity
  
  
  - Suppose we wanted dissimilarity between English and
    Norwegian. It's the number of first letters that are different.
    
    
  - First get the lines for English:
    
```{r}
english = lang.long %>% filter(language=="en")
english
```     
  
  


## And then the lines for Norwegian
  
```{r}
norwegian = lang.long %>% filter(language=="no")
norwegian
```   

And now we want to put them side by side, matched by number. This is
what `left_join` does. (A "join" is a lookup of values in
one table using another.)
  


## The join
  

```{r}
english %>% left_join(norwegian, by="number")
```   

`first.x` is 1st letter of English word, `first.y` 1st
letter of Norwegian word.



## Counting the different ones
  
```{r}
english %>% left_join(norwegian, by="number") %>%
  mutate(different=(first.x!=first.y)) %>%
  summarize(diff=sum(different))
```   

Words for 1 and 8 start with different letter; rest are same.
  


## Function to do this for any two languages
  
```{r}
countdiff=function(lang.1,lang.2,d) {
    lang1d=d %>% filter(language==lang.1)
    lang2d=d %>% filter(language==lang.2)
    lang1d %>% left_join(lang2d, by="number") %>%
        mutate(different=(first.x!=first.y)) %>%
        summarize(diff=sum(different)) %>% 
        pull(diff)
}
```   
  
Test:

```{r}
countdiff("en","no",lang.long)
``` 



## For all pairs of languages?
  
  
  - First need all the languages:
    
```{r}
options(width=50)
```     
```{r}
languages=names(lang)
languages
```     

- and then all *pairs* of languages:
  
```{r}
pairs=crossing(lang=languages, lang2=languages) %>% print(n=12)
```   
  
  


## Run `countdiff for all those language pairs`
  
```{r}
thediffs = pairs %>% 
    mutate(diff=map2_int(lang,lang2,countdiff,lang.long)) %>% 
    print(n=12)
```   
  


## Make square table of these

```{r}
options(width=60)
```  
  
```{r}
thediffs %>% pivot_wider(names_from=lang2, values_from=diff)
```   

and that was where we began.
  



## Another example

Birth, death and infant mortality rates for 97 countries (variables not dissimilarities):


```
24.7  5.7  30.8 Albania         12.5 11.9  14.4 Bulgaria
13.4 11.7  11.3 Czechoslovakia  12   12.4   7.6 Former_E._Germany
11.6 13.4  14.8 Hungary         14.3 10.2    16 Poland
13.6 10.7  26.9 Romania           14    9  20.2 Yugoslavia
17.7   10    23 USSR            15.2  9.5  13.1 Byelorussia_SSR
13.4 11.6    13 Ukrainian_SSR   20.7  8.4  25.7 Argentina
46.6   18   111 Bolivia         28.6  7.9    63 Brazil
23.4  5.8  17.1 Chile           27.4  6.1    40 Columbia
32.9  7.4    63 Ecuador         28.3  7.3    56 Guyana
...
```



- Want to find groups of similar countries (and how many groups, which countries in each group).
- Tree would be unwieldy with 97 countries.
- More automatic way of finding given number of clusters?

  


## Reading in

  
```{r}
my_url="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/birthrate.txt"
vital=read_table(my_url)
``` 



## The data

```{r}
vital
```   



## Standardizing



- Infant mortality rate numbers bigger than others, consequence of
  measurement scale (arbitrary).
- Standardize (numerical) columns of data frame to have mean 0, SD
  1, done by `scale`.


```{r}
vital.s = vital %>% mutate_if(is.numeric,scale) %>% print(n=10)
```   
  


## Three clusters
  
  Pretend we know 3 clusters is good. Take off the 4th column (of
  countries) and run `kmeans` on the resulting data frame,
  asking for 3 clusters:

```{r}
set.seed(457299)
```   

```{r}
vital.km3 = vital.s %>% select(-4) %>% kmeans(3)
names(vital.km3)
```   
  
  
  A lot of output, so look at these individually.
  



## What's in the output?
  
  
  - Cluster sizes:
    

```{r}
vital.km3$size
```  

- Cluster centres:
  
```{r}
vital.km3$centers
```  

- Cluster 2 has lower than average rates on everything; cluster 3
  has much higher than average.
    
  
  


## Cluster sums of squares and membership
  
```{r}
vital.km3$withinss
```  

Cluster 1 compact relative to others (countries in cluster 1  more similar).

```{r}
vital.km3$cluster
```  

The cluster membership for each of the 97 countries.



  



## Store countries and clusters to which they belong
  
```{r}
vital.3=tibble(country=vital.s$country,
               cluster=vital.km3$cluster)
```   

Next, which countries in which cluster? 

Write function to extract them:

```{r}
get_countries=function(i,d) {
    d %>% filter(cluster==i) %>% pull(country)
}
``` 



## Cluster membership: cluster 2


```{r}
get_countries(2,vital.3)
```   



## Cluster 3
```{r}
get_countries(3,vital.3)
```   


## Cluster 1

```{r}
get_countries(1,vital.3)
```   


## Problem!
  
  
  - `kmeans` uses randomization. So result of one run might
    be different from another run.
  - Example: just run again on 3 clusters, `table` of results:
```{r}
set.seed(457298)
``` 
    
```{r}
vital.km3a=vital.s %>% select(-4) %>% kmeans(3)
table(first=vital.km3$cluster,
      second=vital.km3a$cluster)
```
- Clusters are similar but *not same*.
  
- Solution: `nstart` option on `kmeans` runs that
  many times, takes best. Should be same every time:
```{r}
vital.km3b = vital.s %>% select(-4) %>% 
    kmeans(3,nstart=20)
```   
    
    
  
  


## How many clusters?
  
  
  - Three was just a guess.
  - Idea: try a whole bunch of \#clusters (say 2--20), obtain measure of
    goodness of fit for each, make plot.
  - Appropriate measure is `tot.withinss`.
  - Use loop to run `kmeans` for each \#clusters, keep
    track of `tot.withinss`.
  
  


## Function to get `tot.withinss`
  
  ... for an input number of clusters, taking only numeric columns
  of input data frame:
  
```{r}
ss=function(i,d) {
    km = d %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>%
        kmeans(i,nstart=20)
    km$tot.withinss
}
```  

Note: writing function to be as general as possible, so that we can
re-use it later.
  


## Constructing within-cluster SS
    
  Make a data frame with desired numbers of clusters, and fill it with
  the total within-group sums of squares. "For each number of
  clusters, run `ss`", so `map_dbl`.
  
```{r}
ssd = tibble(clusters=2:20) %>%
    mutate(wss=map_dbl(clusters,ss,vital.s)) %>% 
    print(n=10)
```   



## Scree plot

```{r}
ggplot(ssd,aes(x=clusters,y=wss))+geom_point()+
  geom_line()
```   
  


## Interpreting scree plot
  
  
  - Lower `wss` better.
  - But lower for larger \#clusters, harder to explain.
  - Compromise: low-ish `wss` and low-ish \#clusters.
  - Look for "elbow" in plot.
  - Idea: this is where `wss` decreases fast then slow.
  - On our plot, small elbow at 6 clusters. Try this many clusters.
  
  


## Six clusters, using `nstart`
  
```{r}
vital.km6 = vital.s %>% select(-4) %>% 
    kmeans(6,nstart=20)
vital.km6$size
vital.km6$centers
vital.6=tibble(country=vital.s$country,
               cluster=vital.km6$cluster)
```   
  


## Cluster 1

  Below-average death rate, though other rates a little higher than average:

  
```{r}
get_countries(1,vital.6)
```   
  

## Cluster 2

    High on everything:
  
```{r}
options(width=60)
get_countries(2,vital.6)
options(width=50)
```   
  

## Cluster 3

  Low on everything, though death rate close to average:

  
```{r}
get_countries(3,vital.6)
```   
  

## Cluster 4

    Low on everything, especially death rate:

  
```{r}
get_countries(4,vital.6)
```   
  

## Cluster 5

  Higher than average on everything, though not the highest:
  
```{r}
get_countries(5,vital.6)
```   
  

## Cluster 6

    Very high death rate, just below average on all else:

  
```{r}
get_countries(6,vital.6)
```   
  


## Comparing our 3 and 6-cluster solutions
  
```{r}
table(three=vital.km3$cluster,six=vital.km6$cluster)
```   

Compared to 3-cluster solution:


- most of cluster 1 gone to (new) cluster 1
- cluster 2 split into clusters 3 and 4 (two types of "richer" countries)
- cluster 3 split into clusters 2 and 5 (two types of "poor"
  countries, divided by death rate).
- cluster 6 (Mexico and Korea) was split before.

  



## Getting a picture from `kmeans`
  
  
  - Use multidimensional scaling (later)
  - Use discriminant analysis on clusters found, treating them as
    "known" groups.
  
  



## MANOVA and discriminant analysis
  
  
  - Go back to 1st 3 columns of `vital.s` (variables,
    standardized), plus `cf` (cluster as factor).
    `clus` (6 clusters).
  - First, do they actually differ by group? (MANOVA):
```{r}
v = vital.s %>% select(-4) %>% as.matrix()
cf = as.factor(vital.km6$cluster)
vital.manova=manova(v~cf)
summary(vital.manova)
```  

Oh yes.
    
  
  


## Discriminant analysis
  
  
  - So what makes the groups different?
  - Uses package `MASS` (loaded):
    
  
```{r}
vital.lda=lda(cf~birth+death+infant,data=vital.s)
vital.lda$svd
vital.lda$scaling
```  
- LD1 is some of everything, but not so much death rate
  (high=rich, low=poor).
- LD2 mainly death rate, high or low.
    
  
  


## To make a plot
  
  
  
  - Get predictions first:
```{r}
vital.pred=predict(vital.lda)
d=data.frame(country=vital.s$country,
  cluster=vital.km6$cluster,vital.pred$x)
glimpse(d)
```   
%$ %$ %$

- `d` contains country names, cluster memberships and
  discriminant scores. Plot `LD1` against `LD2`,
  colouring points by cluster and labelling by country:
  
```{r}
g=ggplot(d,aes(x=LD1,y=LD2,colour=factor(cluster),
    label=country))+geom_point()+
    geom_text_repel(size=2)+guides(colour=F)
```   
    
  
  


## The plot
  
```{r}
g
```   


## Final example: a hockey league

  
  - 
An Ontario hockey league has teams in 21 cities. How can we arrange those teams into 4 geographical divisions?
- Distance data in spreadsheet.
- Take out spaces in team names.
- Save as "text/csv".
  - Distances, so back to `hclust`.

  - Can't have divisions of 1 team!
  - "Southern" divisions way too big!
  - Try splitting into more. I found 7 to be good:
  

  


## Seven clusters
  
```{r} 
plot(ontario.hc)
rect.hclust(ontario.hc,7)
```   
  


## Divisions now
  
  
  - I want to put Huntsville and North Bay together with northern teams.
  - I'll put the Eastern teams together. Gives:
    
    - North: Sault Ste Marie, Sudbury, Huntsville, North Bay
    - East: Brockville, Cornwall, Ottawa, Peterborough,
      Belleville, Kingston
    - West:  Windsor, London, Sarnia
    - Central: Owen Sound, Barrie, Toronto, Niagara Falls, St
      Catharines, Brantford, Hamilton, Kitchener
    
  - Getting them same size beyond us!
