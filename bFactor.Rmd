## Principal components and factor analysis


* Principal components: 


* Purely mathematical.

* Find eigenvalues, eigenvectors of correlation matrix.

* No testing whether observed components reproducible, or even probability model behind it.


* Factor analysis: 


* some way towards fixing this (get test of appropriateness)

* In factor analysis, each variable modelled as: "common factor" (eg. verbal ability) and "specific factor" (left over).

* Choose the common factors to "best" reproduce pattern seen in correlation matrix.

* Iterative procedure, different answer from principal components.





## Packages
```{r warning=F, message=F}
library(lavaan) # confirmatory factor analysis
library(ggbiplot)
library(tidyverse)
```

   


## Example


* 
145 children given 5 tests, called PARA, SENT, WORD, ADD and DOTS. 3 linguistic tasks (paragraph comprehension, sentence completion  and word meaning), 2 mathematical ones (addition and counting dots).

* Correlation matrix of scores on the tests:


```

para 1     0.722 0.714 0.203 0.095
sent 0.722 1     0.685 0.246 0.181
word 0.714 0.685 1     0.170 0.113
add  0.203 0.246 0.170 1     0.585
dots 0.095 0.181 0.113 0.585 1

```



* Is there small number of underlying "constructs" (unobservable) that explains this pattern of correlations?



## To start: principal components

Using correlation matrix:

```{r kids-scree,message=F}
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/rex2.txt"
kids <- read_delim(my_url, " ")
kids
kids.pc <- kids %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  princomp(covmat = .)
```

 



## Scree plot
```{r fig.height=3.5}
ggscreeplot(kids.pc)
```

   


## Principal component results


* Need 2 components. Loadings:
```{r size="footnotesize"}
kids.pc$loadings
```




* First component has a bit of everything, though especially the
first three tests.

* Second component rather more clearly `add` and `dots`.

* No scores, plots since no actual data.


## Factor analysis


* Specify number of factors first, get solution with exactly
that many factors.

* Includes hypothesis test, need to specify how many children
wrote the tests.

* Works from correlation matrix via `covmat` or actual
data, like `princomp`.

* Introduces extra feature, *rotation*, to make
interpretation of loadings (factor-variable relation) easier.



## Factor analysis for the kids data


* Create "covariance list" to include number of children who
wrote the tests.

* Feed this into `factanal`, specifying how many factors (2).

```{r }
km <- kids %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  as.matrix()
km2 <- list(cov = km, n.obs = 145)
kids.f2 <- factanal(factors = 2, covmat = km2)
```

   



## Uniquenesses

```{r }
kids.f2$uniquenesses
```
$


* Uniquenesses say how "unique" a variable is (size of
specific factor). Small
uniqueness means that the variable is summarized by a factor (good).

* Mildly worried by how large `add`'s uniqueness is.

* Also see "communality" for this, where *large* is good.



## Loadings
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.58\linewidth}

```{r size="footnotesize"}
kids.f2$loadings
```
$
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.40\linewidth}


* Loadings show how each factor depends on variables. Blanks
indicate "small", less than 0.1.

* Factor 1 clearly the "linguistic" tasks, factor 2 clearly
the "mathematical" ones.

* Two factors together explain 68\% of variability (like
regression R-squared).
    
\end{minipage}

## Are 2 factors enough?
```{r }
kids.f2$STATISTIC
kids.f2$dof
kids.f2$PVAL
```

   

P-value not small, so 2 factors OK.


## 1 factor

```{r }
kids.f1 <- factanal(factors = 1, covmat = km2)
kids.f1$STATISTIC
kids.f1$dof
kids.f1$PVAL
```

   

1 factor rejected (P-value small). Definitely need more than 1.


## Track running records revisited

```{r fig.height=3.5}
g2
```

   



## Benefit of rotation


* 100m and marathon arrows almost perpendicular, but components
don't match anything much:


* sprinting: top left and bottom right

* distance running: bottom left and top right.


* Can we arrange things so that components (factors) correspond
to something meaningful?



## Track records by factor analysis
Obtain factor scores (have actual data):
```{r track-factor-biplot,size="footnotesize"}
track
track.f <- track %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  factanal(2, scores = "r")
```

   


## Track data biplot
Not so nice-looking:  
```{r siracusa,fig.height=4}
biplot(track.f$scores, track.f$loadings,
  xlabs = track$country
)
```

   


## Comments


* This time 100m "up" (factor 2), marathon "right" (factor 1).

* Countries most negative on factor 2 good at sprinting.

* Countries most negative on factor 1 good at distance running.



## Rotated factor loadings
{\small
```{r }
track.f$loadings
```
def 
}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Which countries are good at sprinting or
distance running?}
Make a data frame with the countries and scores in:

```{r }
scores <- data.frame(
  country = track$country,
  track.f$scores
)
scores %>% slice(1:6)
```

 


## The best sprinting countries
Most negative on factor 2:  

```{r warning=F,size="footnotesize"}
scores %>%
  arrange(Factor2) %>%
  left_join(iso, by = c("country" = "ISO2")) %>%
  select(Country, Factor1, Factor2) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

 


## The best distance-running countries
Most negative on factor 1:

```{r warning=F, size="footnotesize"}
scores %>%
  arrange(Factor1) %>%
  left_join(iso, by = c("country" = "ISO2")) %>%
  select(Country, Factor1, Factor2) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

 

## A bigger example: BEM sex role inventory


* 369 women asked to rate themselves on 60 traits, like "self-reliant" or "shy".

* Rating 1 "never or almost never true of me" to 7 ``always or
almost always true of me''.

* 60 personality traits is a lot. Can we find a smaller number
of factors that capture aspects of personality?

* The whole BEM sex role inventory on next page.



## The whole inventory


![](bem.png)




## Some of the data

```{r bem-scree,size="scriptsize",message=F}
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/factor.txt"
bem <- read_tsv(my_url)
bem
```

   


## Principal components first
\ldots to decide on number of factors:
```{r }
bem.pc <- bem %>%
  select(-subno) %>%
  princomp(cor = T)
```

   


## The scree plot
```{r genoa,fig.height=3.5}
g <- ggscreeplot(bem.pc)
g
```

 


* No obvious elbow.
  
![](bFactor-bem-scree.png)



## Zoom in to search for elbow
```{r bem-scree-two,fig.height=3.5,warning=F}
g + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 8))
```



Possible elbows at 3 (2 factors) and 6 (5).


## but is 2 really good?
{\scriptsize
```{r }
summary(bem.pc)
```

   
}



## Comments


* Want overall fraction of variance explained (``cumulative
proportion'') to be reasonably high.

* 2 factors, 28.5\%. Terrible!

* Even 56\% (10 factors) not that good!

* Have to live with that.




## Biplot

```{r bem-biplot,fig.height=3.5,}
ggbiplot(bem.pc, alpha = 0.3)
```
  
![](bFactor-bem-biplot.png)


## Comments


* Ignore individuals for now.

* Most variables point to 10 o'clock or 7 o'clock.

* Suggests factor analysis with rotation will get interpretable
factors (rotate to 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock, for example).

* Try for 2-factor solution (rough interpretation, will be bad):

```{r }
bem.2 <- bem %>%
  select(-subno) %>%
  factanal(factors = 2)
```



* Show output in pieces (just print `bem.2` to see all of it).



## Uniquenesses
```{r echo=-1,size="scriptsize"}
options(width = 60)
bem.2$uniquenesses
```

   



* Mostly high or very high (bad).

* Some smaller, eg.:
Leadership ability (0.409),
Acts like leader (0.417),
Warm (0.476),
Tender (0.493).

* Smaller uniquenesses captured by one of our two factors.



## Factor loadings, some

```{r size="scriptsize"}
bem.2$loadings
```




## Making a data frame
There are too many to read easily, so make a data frame. This is a
bit tricky:
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings <- as.data.frame(unclass(bem.2$loadings)) %>%
  mutate(trait = rownames(bem.2$loadings))
loadings %>% slice(1:10)
```

   


## Pick out the big ones on factor 1

Arbitrarily defining $>0.4$ or $<-0.4$ as "big":
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>% filter(abs(Factor1) > 0.4)
```




## Factor 2, the big ones
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>% filter(abs(Factor2) > 0.4)
```

   


## Plotting the two factors
A bi-plot, this time with the variables reduced in size. Looking for
unusual individuals.

Have to run `factanal` again to get factor scores for plotting.

```{r biplot-two-again,fig.height=5,eval=F}
bem.2a <- factanal(bem[, -1], factors = 2, scores = "r")
biplot(bem.2a$scores, bem.2a$loadings, cex = c(0.5, 0.5))
```

 

Numbers on plot are row numbers of `bem`
data frame.


## The (awful) biplot

![](bFactor-biplot-two-again.png)
 
```{r biplot-two-ag,fig.height=4,echo=F}
bem.2a <- factanal(bem[, -1], factors = 2, scores = "r")
biplot(bem.2a$scores, bem.2a$loadings, cex = c(0.5, 0.5))
```

 


## Comments


* Variables mostly up ("feminine") and right ("masculine"),
accomplished by rotation.

* Some unusual individuals: 311, 214 (low on factor 2), 366
(high on factor 2),
359, 258
(low on factor 1), 230 (high on factor 1).



## Individual 366
\begin{multicols}{2}
```{r size="tiny"}
bem %>% slice(366) %>% glimpse()
```

 



* High on factor 2, but hard to see which traits should have high scores
(unless we remember).

* Idea: *tidy* original data frame to make easier to look
things up.

\end{multicols}


## Tidying original data
```{r size="scriptsize"}
bem_tidy <- bem %>%
  mutate(row = row_number()) %>%
  gather(trait, score, c(-subno, -row))
bem_tidy
```

   


## Recall data frame of loadings
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>% slice(1:10)
```

   

Want to add the factor scores for each trait to our tidy data frame
`bem_tidy`. This is a left-join (over), matching on the column
`trait` that is in both data frames (thus, the default):


## Looking up loadings
```{r size="scriptsize"}
bem_tidy <- bem_tidy %>% left_join(loadings)
bem_tidy %>% sample_n(12)
```

   


## Individual 366, high on Factor 2
So now pick out the rows of the tidy data frame that belong to
individual 366 (`row=366`) and for which the `Factor2`
score exceeds 0.4 in absolute value (our "big" from before):

```{r size="footnotesize"}
bem_tidy %>% filter(row == 366, abs(Factor2) > 0.4)
```

 
As expected, high scorer on these.


## Several individuals
Rows 311 and 214 were *low* on Factor 2, so their scores should
be low. Can we do them all at once?
```{r size="footnotesize"}
bem_tidy %>% filter(
  row %in% c(366, 311, 214),
  abs(Factor2) > 0.4
)
```

   

Can we display each individual in own column?


## Individual by column
Un-`tidy`, that is, `spread`:

```{r size="scriptsize"}
bem_tidy %>%
  filter(
    row %in% c(366, 311, 214),
    abs(Factor2) > 0.4
  ) %>%
  select(-subno, -Factor1, -Factor2) %>%
  spread(row, score)
```

 
366 high, 311 middling, 214 (sometimes) low.


## Individuals 230, 258, 359
These were high, low, low on factor 1. Adapt code:
```{r size="scriptsize"}
bem_tidy %>%
  filter(row %in% c(359, 258, 230), abs(Factor1) > 0.4) %>%
  select(-subno, -Factor1, -Factor2) %>%
  spread(row, score)
```

 


## Is 2 factors enough?
Suspect not:
```{r }
bem.2$PVAL
```

   

2 factors resoundingly rejected. Need more. Have to go all the way to
15 factors to not reject:

```{r }
bem.15 <- bem %>%
  select(-subno) %>%
  factanal(factors = 15)
bem.15$PVAL
```

 

Even then, only just over 50\% of variability explained.

Let's have a look at the important things in those 15 factors.



## Get factor loadings
into a data frame, as before:  
```{r size="small"}
loadings <- as.data.frame(unclass(bem.15$loadings)) %>%
  mutate(trait = rownames(bem.15$loadings))
```

   

then show the highest few loadings on each factor.



## Factor 1
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(Factor1))) %>%
  select(Factor1, trait) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

   
Compassionate, understanding, sympathetic, soothing: thoughtful of
others. 



## Factor 2
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(Factor2))) %>%
  select(Factor2, trait) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

## Factor 3
```{r size="footnotesize"}

Being the best.



## Factor 6
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(Factor6))) %>%
  select(Factor6, trait) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

   

Acts like a leader, leadership ability (with a bit of Dominant):
Taking charge.



## Factor 7
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(Factor7))) %>%
  select(Factor7, trait) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

   

Acts like a leader, leadership ability (with a bit of Dominant):

## Factor 9
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(Factor9))) %>%

```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(Factor10))) %>%
  select(Factor10, trait) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

   

Feminine. (A little bit of not-masculine!)



## Factor 11
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(Factor11))) %>%
  select(Factor11, trait) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

   

Loyal.



## Factor 12
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(Factor12))) %>%
  select(Factor12, trait) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

   

Childlike. (With a bit of moody, shy, not-self-sufficient, not-conscientious.)



## Factor 13
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(Factor13))) %>%
  select(Factor13, trait) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

   

Truthful. (With a bit of happy and not-gullible.)

  select(Factor14, trait) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

## Factor 15
```{r size="footnotesize"}
loadings %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(Factor15))) %>%
  select(Factor15, trait) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

   

Not-compassionate, athletic, sensitive: A mixed bag. ("Cares about self"?)


## Anything left out? Uniquenesses
```{r size="scriptsize"}
data.frame(uniq = bem.15$uniquenesses) %>%
  rownames_to_column() %>%
  arrange(desc(uniq)) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

   

Uses foul language especially, also loves children and analytical. So
could use even more factors.


\section{Confirmatory factor analysis}
\frame{\sectionpage}
## Confirmatory factor analysis


* Exploratory: what do data suggest as hidden underlying factors (in terms of variables observed)?

* Confirmatory: have {\em theory} about how underlying factors depend on observed variables; test whether theory supported by data:


* does theory provide {\em some} explanation (better than nothing)

* can we do better?


* Also can compare two theories about factors: is more complicated one significantly better than simpler one?



## Children and tests again



* Previously had this correlation matrix of test scores (based on 145
children):

```{r }
km
```
def 


* Will use package `lavaan` for confirmatory analysis.

* Can use actual data or correlation matrix.

* Latter (a bit) more work, as we see.




## Two or three steps


* Make sure correlation matrix (if needed) is handy.

* Specify factor model (from theory)

* Fit factor model: does it fit acceptably? 



## Specifying a factor model


* Jargon: thing you cannot observe called **latent variable**.

* Thing you *can* observe called **manifest variable**.

* Model predicts latent variables from manifest variables.

* Model with one factor including all the tests:
```{r }
test.model.1 <- "ability=~para+sent+word+add+dots"
```
def 


* and a model that we really believe, that there are two factors,
a verbal and a mathematical:
```{r }
test.model.2 <- "\nverbal=~para+sent+word\nmath=~add+dots"
```
def 

* Note the format: really all one line between single quotes, but
putting it on several lines makes the layout clearer.

* Also note special notation `=textasciitilde` for ``this latent
variable depends on these observed variables''.  



## Fitting a 1-factor model


* Need to specify model, correlation matrix, $n$ like this:

```{r }
fit1 <- cfa(test.model.1,
  sample.cov = km,
  sample.nobs = 145
)
```
def 


* Has `summary`, or briefer version like this:
```{r size="scriptsize"}
fit1
```
def 

* Test of fit: null "model fits" *rejected*. We can do better.



## Two-factor model
```{r size="scriptsize"}
fit2 <- cfa(test.model.2, sample.cov = km, sample.nobs = 145)
fit2
```
def 



* This fits OK: 2-factor model supported by the data.

* 1-factor model did not fit. We really need 2 factors.

* Same conclusion as from `factanal` earlier.



## Comparing models


* Use `anova` as if this were a regression:

```{r size="scriptsize"}
anova(fit1, fit2)
```
def 


* 2-factor model fits significantly better than 1-factor.

* No surprise!



## Track and field data, yet again


* `cfa` works easier on actual data, such as the running records:
{\small 

```{r size="footnotesize"}
track %>% print(n = 6)
```
def 
}


* Specify factor model. Factors seemed to be "sprinting" (up to
800m) and "distance running" (beyond):
```{r size="footnotesize"}
track.model <- "\nsprint=~m100+m200+m400+m800\ndistance=~m1500+m5000+m10000+marathon"
```
def 


## Fit and examine the model


* Fit the model. The observed variables are on different
scales, so we should standardize them first via `std.ov`:
```{r size="scriptsize"}
track.1 <- track %>%
  select(-country) %>%
  cfa(track.model, data = ., std.ov = T)
track.1
```
def 


* This fits badly. Can we do better?

* Idea: move middle distance races (800m, 1500m) into a third factor.


## Factor model 2


* Define factor model:

```{r }
track.model.2 <- "\nsprint=~m100+m200+m400\nmiddle=~m800+m1500\ndistance=~m5000+m10000+marathon"
```
def 


* Fit and examine:
```{r size="scriptsize"}
track.2 <- track %>%
  select(-country) %>%
  cfa(track.model.2, data = ., std.ov = T)
track.2
```
def 


* Fits  marginally better, though still badly.



## Comparing the two models


* Second model doesn't fit well, but is it better than first?
{\small    

```{r size="footnotesize"}

anova(track.1, track.2)
```
def
}

* Oh yes, a lot better.


```{r echo=F, warning=F}
pkgs <- names(sessionInfo()$otherPkgs)
pkgs <- paste("package:", pkgs, sep = "")
x <- lapply(pkgs, detach, character.only = TRUE, unload = TRUE)
```
