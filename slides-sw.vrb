\frametitle{General procedure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Start with ``complete model'' including all possible interactions.
\item \texttt{drop1} gives highest-order interaction(s) remaining, remove least non-significant.
\item Repeat as necessary until everything significant.
\item Look at subtables of significant interactions.
  \item Main effects not usually very interesting.
\item Interactions with ``response'' usually of most interest: show association with response.
\end{itemize}
