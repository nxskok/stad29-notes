# Review of (multiple) regression

## Regression


* Use regression when one variable is an outcome (*response*, $y$).

* See if/how response depends on other variable(s), *explanatory*, $x_1, x_2,\ldots$.

* Can have *one* or *more than one* explanatory variable, but always one response.

* Assumes a *straight-line* relationship between response and explanatory.

* Ask: 


  * *is there* a relationship between $y$ and $x$'s, and if so, which ones?
  * what does the relationship look like?




## Packages
```{r, eval=F }
library(MASS) # for Box-Cox, later
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
```

   


## A regression with one $x$

13 children, measure average total sleep time (ATST, mins) and age (years) for each. See if ATST depends on age. Data in `sleep.txt`, ATST then age. Read in data:
```{r }
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/sleep.txt"
sleep <- read_delim(my_url, " ")
```



## Check data 
```{r size="footnotesize"}
summary(sleep)
```

Make scatter plot of ATST (response) vs. age (explanatory) using
code overleaf: 



## The scatterplot
```{r suggo, fig.height=3.8}
ggplot(sleep, aes(x = age, y = atst)) + geom_point()
```
 






## Correlation


* Measures how well a straight line fits the data:
```{r }
with(sleep, cor(atst, age))
```
 


* $1$ is perfect upward trend, $-1$ is perfect downward trend, 0
is no trend.

* This one close to perfect downward trend.

* Can do correlations of all pairs of variables:
```{r }
cor(sleep)
```
 


## Lowess curve


* Sometimes nice to guide the eye: is the trend straight, or not?

* Idea: *lowess curve*. "Locally weighted least squares",
not affected by outliers, not constrained to be linear.

* Lowess is a *guide*: even if straight line appropriate,
may wiggle/bend a little. Looking for *serious* problems with
linearity. 

* Add lowess curve to plot using `geom_smooth`:



## Plot with lowess curve
```{r icko,fig.height=3}
ggplot(sleep, aes(x = age, y = atst)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```
 

## The regression

Scatterplot shows no obvious curve, and a pretty clear downward trend. So we can run the regression:

```{r echo=-1}
options(width = 60)
sleep.1 <- lm(atst ~ age, data = sleep)
```
 
## The output 

\scriptsize
```{r}
summary(sleep.1)
```
\normalsize



## Conclusions


* The relationship appears to be a straight line, with a downward trend.

* $F$-tests for model as a whole and $t$-test for slope (same)
both confirm this (P-value $5.7\times 10^{-7}=0.00000057$).

* Slope is $-14$, so a 1-year increase in age goes with a 14-minute decrease in ATST on average.

* R-squared is correlation squared (when one $x$ anyway),
between 0 and 1 (1 good, 0 bad).

* Here R-squared is 0.9054, pleasantly high.



## Doing things with the regression output


* Output from regression (and eg. $t$-test) is all right to
look at, but hard to extract and re-use information from.

* Package `broom` extracts info from model output in way
that can be used in pipe (later):
```{r size="footnotesize"}
tidy(sleep.1)
```

## also one-line summary of model:

```{r}
glance(sleep.1)
```




## Broom part 2
```{r size="footnotesize",warning=F}
sleep.1 %>% augment(sleep) %>% slice(1:8)
```

   
Useful for plotting residuals against an $x$-variable.

## CI for mean response and prediction intervals

Once useful regression exists, use it for prediction:


* To get a single number for prediction at a given $x$, substitute into regression equation, eg. age 10: predicted ATST is $646.48-14.04(10)=506$ minutes.

* To express uncertainty of this prediction:


* *CI for mean response* expresses uncertainty about mean ATST for all children aged 10, based on data.

* *Prediction interval* expresses uncertainty about predicted ATST for a new child aged 10 whose ATST not known. More uncertain.


* Also do above for a child aged 5.



## Intervals


* Make new data frame with these values for `age`
```{r }
my.age <- c(10, 5)
ages.new <- tibble(age = my.age)
ages.new
```

   


* Feed into `predict`:
```{r }
pc <- predict(sleep.1, ages.new, interval = "c")
pp <- predict(sleep.1, ages.new, interval = "p")
```
 




## The intervals
Confidence intervals for mean response:
```{r }
cbind(ages.new, pc)
```
 

Prediction intervals for new response:
```{r }
cbind(ages.new, pp)
```
 

## Comments



* Age 10 closer to centre of data, so intervals are both narrower than those for age 5.

* Prediction intervals bigger than CI for mean (additional uncertainty).

* Technical note: output from `predict` is R
`matrix`, not data frame, so Tidyverse `bind_cols`
does not work. Use base R `cbind`.



## That grey envelope

Marks confidence interval for mean for all $x$: 

```{r fig.height=3.0}
ggplot(sleep, aes(x = age, y = atst)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(420, 600, 20))
```

   



## Diagnostics
How to tell whether a straight-line regression is appropriate?

\vspace{3ex}



* Before: check scatterplot for straight trend.

* After: plot *residuals* (observed minus predicted response) against predicted values. Aim: a plot with no pattern.

## Residual plot 

Not much pattern here --- regression appropriate.

```{r akjhkadjfhjahnkkk,fig.height=3.4}
ggplot(sleep.1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```
 




## An inappropriate regression

Different data:  
```{r curvy}
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/curvy.txt"
curvy <- read_delim(my_url, " ")
```


## Scatterplot 
```{r fig.height=3.8}
ggplot(curvy, aes(x = xx, y = yy)) + geom_point()
```

## Regression line, anyway


\scriptsize
```{r}
curvy.1 <- lm(yy ~ xx, data = curvy)
summary(curvy.1)
```
\normalsize

## Residual plot 
```{r altoadige,fig.height=3.8}
ggplot(curvy.1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```
 



## No good: fixing it up


* Residual plot has *curve*: middle residuals positive, high and low ones negative. Bad.

* Fitting a curve would be better. Try this:
```{r }
curvy.2 <- lm(yy ~ xx + I(xx^2), data = curvy)
```
 


* Adding `xx`-squared term, to allow for curve.

* Another way to do same thing: specify how model *changes*:
```{r }
curvy.2a <- update(curvy.1, . ~ . + I(xx^2))
```

 


## Regression 2 

```{r }
tidy(curvy.2)
glance(curvy.2) #
```


## Comments


* `xx`-squared term definitely significant (P-value
0.000182), so need this curve to describe relationship.

* Adding squared term has made R-squared go up from 0.5848 to
0.9502: great improvement.

* This is a definite curve!



## The residual plot now  
No problems any more:

```{r size="small", fig.height=3.4}
ggplot(curvy.2, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```
 





## Another way to handle curves


* Above, saw that changing $x$ (adding $x^2$) was a way of
handling curved relationships.

* Another way: change $y$ (transformation).

* Can guess how to change $y$, or might be theory:


* example: relationship $y=ae^{bx}$ (exponential growth): 

* take
logs to get $\ln y=\ln a + bx$.

* Taking logs has made relationship linear ($\ln y$ as response).


* Or, *estimate* transformation, using Box-Cox method. 



## Box-Cox


* Install package `MASS` via
`install.packages("MASS")` (only need to do *once*)

* Every R session you want to use something in `MASS`, type
`library(MASS)`



## Some made-up data
```{r message=F}
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/madeup.csv"
madeup <- read_csv(my_url)
madeup
```
 
Seems to be faster-than-linear growth, maybe exponential growth. 


## Scatterplot: faster than linear growth 
```{r dsljhsdjlhf,fig.height=3.2}
ggplot(madeup, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```
 


## Running Box-Cox


* `library(MASS)` first.

* Feed `boxcox` a model formula with a squiggle in it,
such as you would use for `lm`.

* Output: a graph (next page):
```{r eval=F}
boxcox(y ~ x, data = madeup)
```
 



## The Box-Cox output
```{r trento,echo=F, fig.height=4}
boxcox(y ~ x, data = madeup)
```
 


## Comments


* $\lambda$ (lambda) is the power by which you should transform
$y$ to get the relationship straight (straighter). Power 0 is
"take logs"

* Middle dotted line marks best single value of $\lambda$ (here
about 0.1).

* Outer dotted lines mark 95\% CI for $\lambda$, here $-0.3$ to
0.7, approx. (Rather uncertain about best transformation.)

* Any power transformation within the CI supported by data. In
this case, log ($\lambda=0$) and square root ($\lambda=0.5$) good,
but no transformation ($\lambda=1$)  not.

* Pick a "round-number" value of $\lambda$ like
$2,1,0.5,0,-0.5,-1$. Here 0 and 0.5 good values to pick. 



## Did transformation straighten things?

* Plot transformed $y$ against $x$. Here, log:
```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.2 }
ggplot(madeup, aes(x = x, y = log(y))) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```
 

Looks much straighter.


## Regression with transformed $y$



\footnotesize
```{r}
madeup.1 <- lm(log(y) ~ x, data = madeup)
glance(madeup.1)
tidy(madeup.1)
```
\normalsize

R-squared now decently high.

## Multiple regression


* What if more than one $x$? Extra issues:


  * Now one intercept and a slope for each $x$: how to interpret?

  * Which $x$-variables actually help to predict $y$?

  * Different interpretations of "global" $F$-test and individual $t$-tests.

  * R-squared no longer correlation squared, but still
interpreted as "higher better".


  * In `lm` line, add extra $x$s after `~`.

  * Interpretation not so easy (and other problems that can occur).




## Multiple regression example

Study of women and visits to health professionals, and how the number of visits might be related to other variables:

\begin{description}
\item[timedrs:] number of visits to health professionals (over course of study)
\item[phyheal:] number of physical health problems
\item[menheal:] number of mental health problems
\item[stress:] result of questionnaire about number and type of life changes
\end{description}

`timedrs` response, others explanatory.



## The data 
```{r }
my_url <- 
  "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/regressx.txt"
visits <- read_delim(my_url, " ")
```
 


## Check data

\small
```{r}
visits
```
\normalsize

   
## Fit multiple regression

```{r}
visits.1 <- lm(timedrs ~ phyheal + menheal + stress,
  data = visits)
glance(visits.1)
```


## The slopes

Model as a whole strongly significant even though R-sq not very big (lots of data). At least one of the $x$'s predicts `timedrs`.

```{r }
tidy(visits.1)
```
 

The physical health and stress variables initely help to predict the number of visits, but *with those in the model* we don't need `menheal`.
However, look at prediction of `timedrs` from `menheal` by itself:


## Just `menheal` 

\footnotesize 
```{r }
visits.2 <- lm(timedrs ~ menheal, data = visits)
glance(visits.2)
tidy(visits.2)
```
 
\normalsize



## `menheal` by itself


* `menheal` by itself *does* significantly help to predict `timedrs`.

* But the R-sq is much less (6.5\% vs.\ 22\%).

* So other two variables do a better job of prediction.

* With those variables in the regression (`phyheal` and
`stress`), don't need `menheal` *as well*.


## Investigating via correlation
Leave out first column (`subjno`):
```{r }
visits %>% select(-subjno) %>% cor()
```
 


* `phyheal` most strongly correlated with `timedrs`.

* Not much to choose between other two.

* But `menheal` has higher correlation with `phyheal`,
so not as much to *add* to prediction as `stress`.

* Goes to show things more complicated in multiple regression.




## Residual plot (from `timedrs` on all) 
```{r iffy8,fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(visits.1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```
 
## Comment

Apparently random. But\ldots





## Normal quantile plot of residuals
```{r fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(visits.1, aes(sample = .resid)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()
```

   


## Absolute residuals
Is there trend in *size* of residuals (fan-out)? Plot
*absolute value* of residual against fitted value (graph next page):

```{r fig.height=2.8, message=FALSE}
g <- ggplot(visits.1, aes(x = .fitted, y = abs(.resid))) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

## The plot

```{r, echo=F, message=F, fig.height=4.3}
g
```



## Comments


* On the normal quantile plot:


  * highest (most positive) residuals are *way* too high

  * distribution of residuals skewed to right (not normal at all)


* On plot of absolute residuals:


  * size of residuals getting bigger as fitted values increase

  * predictions getting more variable as fitted values increase

  * that is, predictions getting *less accurate* as fitted
values increase, but predictions should be equally accurate all
way along.


* Both indicate problems with regression, of kind that
transformation of response often fixes: that is, predict
*function* of response `timedrs` instead of
`timedrs` itself.




## Box-Cox transformations


* Taking log of `timedrs` and having it work: lucky
guess. How to find good transformation?

* Box-Cox again.

* Extra problem: some of `timedrs` values are 0, but
Box-Cox expects all +. Note response for `boxcox`:
```{r eval=F}
boxcox(timedrs + 1 ~ phyheal + menheal + stress, data = visits)
```
 



## Try 1
```{r echo=F,fig.height=4.5}
  boxcox(timedrs + 1 ~ phyheal + menheal + stress, 
         data = visits)
```
 


## Comments on try 1


* Best: $\lambda$ just less than zero.

* Hard to see scale. 

* Focus on $\lambda$ in $(-0.3,0.1)$: 


\footnotesize
```{r size="footnotesize"}
my.lambda <- seq(-0.3, 0.1, 0.01)
my.lambda
```
 
\normalsize


## Try 2
```{r fig.height=3.5}
boxcox(timedrs + 1 ~ phyheal + menheal + stress,
  lambda = my.lambda,
  data = visits
)
```
 


## Comments


* Best: $\lambda$ just about $-0.07$.

* CI for $\lambda$ about $(-0.14,0.01)$.

* Only nearby round number: $\lambda=0$, log transformation.


## Fixing the problems 


* Try regression again, with transformed response instead of
original one.

* Then check residual plot to see that it is OK now.
```{r }
visits.3 <- lm(log(timedrs + 1) ~ phyheal + menheal + stress,
  data = visits
)
```
 

* `timedrs+1`  because some `timedrs` values 0,
can't take log of 0.

* Won't usually need to worry about this, but when response could
be zero/negative, fix that before transformation.


## Output 

\scriptsize
```{r }
summary(visits.3)
```
 
\normalsize


## Comments 


* Model as a whole strongly significant again 

* R-sq higher than before (37\% vs.\ 22\%) suggesting things more linear now

* Same conclusion re `menheal`: can take out of regression.

* Should look at residual plots (next pages). Have we fixed problems?



## Residuals against fitted values
```{r fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(visits.3, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point()
```

   


## Normal quantile plot of residuals
```{r fig.height=3.8}
ggplot(visits.3, aes(sample = .resid)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()
```

   


## Absolute residuals against fitted
```{r fig.height=3.5, message=F}
ggplot(visits.3, aes(x = .fitted, y = abs(.resid))) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

   


## Comments 


* Residuals vs.\ fitted looks a lot more random.

* Normal quantile plot looks a lot more normal (though still a
little right-skewness)

* Absolute residuals: not so much trend (though still some).

* Not perfect, but much improved.



## Testing more than one $x$ at once

- The $t$-tests test only whether one variable could be taken out of the
regression you're looking at. 
- To test significance of more than one
variable at once, fit model with and without variables 
  - then use `anova` to compare fit of models:


```{r }
visits.5 <- lm(log(timedrs + 1) ~ phyheal + menheal + stress, 
               data = visits)
visits.6 <- lm(log(timedrs + 1) ~ stress, data = visits)
```
 


## Results of tests

```{r}
anova(visits.6, visits.5)
```


* Models don't fit equally well, so bigger one fits better.

* Or "taking both variables out makes the fit worse, so don't do it".

*   Taking out those $x$'s
is a mistake. Or putting them in is a good idea.



## The punting data
Data set `punting.txt` contains 4 variables for 13 right-footed
football kickers (punters): left leg and right leg strength (lbs),
distance punted (ft), another variable called "fred". Predict
punting distance from other variables:

\scriptsize

```

## Regression and output

\small
```{r}
punting.1 <- lm(punt ~ left + right + fred, data = punting)
glance(punting.1)
tidy(punting.1)
```
\normalsize

## Comments


* Overall regression strongly significant, R-sq high.

* None of the $x$'s significant! Why?

* $t$-tests only say that you could take any one of the $x$'s out without damaging the fit; doesn't matter which one.

* Explanation: look at *correlations*. 



## The correlations  
```{r }
cor(punting)
```
 


* *All* correlations are high: $x$'s with `punt` (good) and
with each other (bad, at least confusing).

* What to do? Probably do just as well to pick one variable, say
`right` since kickers are right-footed.



## Just `right`
\small
```{r }
punting.2 <- lm(punt ~ right, data = punting)
anova(punting.2, punting.1)
```
 
\normalsize
No significant loss by dropping other two variables.



## Comparing R-squareds
```{r }
summary(punting.1)$r.squared
summary(punting.2)$r.squared
```
 
Basically no difference. In regression (over), `right` significant:


## Regression results


```{r }
tidy(punting.2)
```
 
## But\ldots


* Maybe we got the *form* of the relationship with
`left` wrong.

* Check: plot *residuals* from previous regression (without
`left`) against `left`.

* Residuals here are ``punting distance adjusted for right
leg strength''.

* If there is some kind of relationship with `left`, we
should include in model.

* Plot of residuals against original variable: `augment`
from `broom`.



## Augmenting `punting.2`
\footnotesize
```{r }
punting.2 %>% augment(punting) -> punting.2.aug
punting.2.aug %>% slice(1:8)
```
\normalsize
   


## Residuals against `left`
```{r basingstoke,fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(punting.2.aug, aes(x = left, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point()
```

   


## Comments


* There is a *curved* relationship with `left`.

* We should add `left`-squared to the regression (and
therefore put `left` back in when we do that):
```{r }
punting.3 <- lm(punt ~ left + I(left^2) + right,
  data = punting
)
```

     



## Regression with `left-squared`
\scriptsize
```{r}
summary(punting.3)
```
\normalsize
   


## Comments


* This was definitely a good idea (R-squared has clearly increased).

* We would never have seen it without plotting residuals from
`punting.2` (without `left`) against `left`.

* Negative slope for `leftsq` means that increased left-leg
strength only increases punting distance up to a point: beyond that,
it decreases again.
