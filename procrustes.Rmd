## Comparing MDS solution with "reality": Procrustes rotation


* How to tell that an MDS map makes a good correspondence with ``what
should be''?

* Problem: MDS map might be rotated/scaled/reflected from reality.

* How to find rotation/scaling/reflection that best matches reality?

* Answer: **Procrustes rotation**.

* In R: `procOPA` in package `shapes`.



## "True" coordinates


* Get latitudes and longitudes of cities by geocoding, as
before. Glue "ON" onto city names to make sure we get right ones: xxx

\footnotesize
```{r message=F, cache=T, eval=F}
lookup <- str_c(ontario2$x, " ON")
latlong <- geocode(lookup)
latlong <- bind_cols(city = ontario2$x, latlong) %>% print(n = 4)
```
\normalsize
    
xxx

\footnotesize
```{r echo=F}
latlong <- readRDS("ontario_all.rds")
latlong %>% print(n = 4)
```
\normalsize
 

* Not $(x,y)$ coordinates: one degree of latitude is always
110.25 km, but one degree of longitude is only that at the equator
(less than that as you move further north, down to 0 km at north
pole).


## "True" coordinates part 2


* Make coordinates by multiplying by cosine of "typical" latitude.

* Find mean latitude:
```{r }
m <- mean(latlong$lat)
m
```

     


* Turn into radians and find its cosine:
```{r }
mult <- cos(m * pi / 180)
mult
```

   


* Create "true" coords by multiplying the longitudes by
that. This needs to be R `matrix`, not data frame: xxx

\footnotesize
```{r}
truecoord <- with(latlong, cbind(V1 = lon * mult, V2 = lat))
```
\normalsize
   


## Using `procOPA`


* Feed 2 things into `procOPA`: first, "true"
coordinates, second MDS coordinates.

* Get out: 


*     (centred and scaled) first set of coordinates `Ahat`

* (centred and scaled) second set of coordinates `Bhat`

* sum of squared differences between two sets of coordinates `OSS`

* Rotation matrix `R`


* `Ahat` and `Bhat` coordinates supposed to
match as well as possible. xxx

\footnotesize
```{r message=F}
ontario.pro <- procOPA(
  truecoord,
  ontario2.2$points
)
names(ontario.pro)
```
\normalsize
     


## Make data frames of output, glue together


* Two sets of coordinates, `Ahat` are actual,
`Bhat` are from MDS. xxx

\scriptsize
```{r}
A <- ontario.pro$Ahat %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(which = "actual", city = ontario2$x)
B <- ontario.pro$Bhat %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(which = "MDS", city = ontario2$x)
dp <- bind_rows(A, B)
dp %>% sample_n(6)
```
\normalsize

 ## `procOPA`, part 2: plotting
 
   
     
* Make data frames of each, glue together: xxx

\small
```{r, warning=F}
A=with(ontario.pro,data.frame(x=Ahat[,1],
   y=Ahat[,2],which="actual",city=ontario2$x)) 
 B=with(ontario.pro,data.frame(x=Bhat[,1],
   y=Bhat[,2],which="MDS",city=ontario2$x))
 dp=bind_rows(A,B)
 dp %>% sample_n(6)
 
```
\normalsize

   
 

## Procrustes rotation plot


* Strategy: plot all the locations, and colour them by whether
they were the true location (red) or the MDS one (blue), which is
in `which`. Label each location with the city name in the
appropriate colour.

* I realized it
was actually easy to join the two instances of a city by a line
(in green, here, 3rd line) by setting `group=city`: xxx

\footnotesize
```{r}
g_opa <- ggplot(dp, aes(
  x = V1, y = V2, colour = which,
  label = city
)) + geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = city), colour = "green") +
  geom_text_repel(size = 2)
```
\normalsize
     

* On plot, look to see whether points that are same city are
joined by a short green line (good) or a long one (bad).



## The maps
```{r prosesto,echo=F,fig.height=4}
g_opa
```

## Comments


* True locations red, MDS locations blue

* Most things in roughly right place (esp.\ relative to other things)

* Extreme cities off by a bit, but OK relative to neighbours.

* St Catharines, Niagara Falls off by most.

* Sarnia, Windsor also off noticeably.

* These four cities had largest "third dimension" in 3D
representation  `ontario2.3`.



## Rotation matrix
Shows how MDS map needs to be rotated to get best match with actual coordinates:
```{r }
ontario.pro$R
```

   

Rotation angle $\theta$ such that $\cos\theta=0.885$,
$\sin\theta=0.466$: $\theta=23$ degrees (counterclockwise). 
$ %$ %$


## Is that right? Look at MDS map again
```{r fig.height=4}
g
```

   

23 degrees counterclockwise seems about right.
