\frametitle {General procedure}\par \begin{itemize}
\item Start with ``complete model'' including all possible interactions.
\item Look at highest-order interaction(s) remaining, remove if non-significant.
\item If an interaction significant, keep also everything contained within that interaction. Eg.\ A*B interaction significant, keep A and B main effects.
\item Continue until everything either significant or must be kept.
\item Then look at maximum likelihood estimates (can fill in those not shown) and interpret according to whether $+$ or $-$.
  \item Main effects not usually very interesting.
\item Interactions with ``response'' usually of most interest: show association with response.
\end{itemize}
