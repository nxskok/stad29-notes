Remember how I carefully changed my lecture notes to replace
\texttt{means} by \texttt{lsmeans} in \texttt{proc glm}? Well, I
shouldn't have done, because you don't have the \texttt{lines} option
on SAS 9.1 (the version that's in Mathlab), and without
\texttt{lines}, it doesn't do much good. So here's how things were
before, which is the way you can make this assignment work.

Let's go back to the jumping rats first. The data looked like this:


\begin{verbatim}

Control	1	621
Control	1	614
Control	1	593

Highjump	3	622
Highjump	3	643
Highjump	3	674
Highjump	3	643
Highjump	3	650
\end{verbatim}


with the variables being the amount of jumping done by each rat, a
numeric version of the group name, and a measure of bone density, all
separated by tabs. Thus:

\begin{Winput}
  data jumping;
  infile "jumping.dat" delimiter='09'x;
  input group $ g density;
\end{Winput}

will read this in, and the following does Tukey and Bonferroni
multiple comparisons.

\begin{Winput}
proc glm;
  class group;
  model density=group;
  means group / tukey lines;
  means group / bon lines;
\end{Winput}

There's no problem with \texttt{lines} here, and the output is as
shown below. This should be the same for you. Notice that
\texttt{lsmeans} has changed to \texttt{means}, and there's no
\texttt{adjust=} in there any more.

Now, the problem comes when you have a significant interaction, and
you want to do Tukey for that. There seems to be no good alternative
than to define all the treatment combinations using \texttt{cat} (just
like we did to get the survival plot) and then doing an analysis on
\emph{that}. This is after we've found that the interaction is significant:

\begin{Winput}
  data scaffold;
  infile "scaffold.dat";
  input material $ weeks gpi;
  mw=cat(material,"-",weeks);

proc glm;
  class mw;
  model gpi=mw;
  means mw / tukey lines;

\end{Winput}

The logic here is that we create a new variable (here \texttt{mw})
that contains all the material-weeks combinations, and then we run a
\emph{one-way} analysis of variance predicting \texttt{gpi} from
that. If you check, the appropriate sums of squares from the output
below match the ones in the output you saw before (model SS and error SS).

Here's the output:

The last line of the code above gets the means for all the
material-weeks combinations, and does Tukey on them. Since \texttt{mw}
is not itself an interaction (as far as SAS is concerned), SAS can do
it OK.

The last part of this example used only the ECM materials. That goes
like this:

\begin{Winput}
  data scaffold;
  infile "scaffold2.dat";
  input material $ weeks gpi;

proc glm;
  class material weeks;
  model gpi=weeks material;
  means material weeks / tukey lines;
  
run;

\end{Winput}

and produces the same output as we had before:
