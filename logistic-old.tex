Predict response as linear function of explanatory variables:

$$ y = \beta_0 +\beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p$$

But if response is success/failure (lived/died)?

Predict {\em probability} of success, but could be predicted as $<0$
or $>1$.
  
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Log-odds}

Idea: predict not probability of success, but {\em log-odds}. If prob
is $p$, log odds is
$$ \ln \left( {p \over 1-p } \right) $$
which could take any value for a legal probability, and is thus a
reasonable thing to be predicted.

To get probability from log-odds $x$:

$$ p = { e^x \over 1 + e^x }$$
